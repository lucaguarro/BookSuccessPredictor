Dusk overtook me toiling along the great\n","Chamounix Road, and in the heart of a most desolate gorge, whose towering\n","snow-flung walls seemed--as the day sucked inwards to a point secret as a\n","leech's mouth--to close about me like a monstrous amphitheatre of ghosts. The rutted road, dipping and climbing toilfully against the shouldering\n","of great tumbled boulders, or winning for itself but narrow foothold over\n","slippery ridges, was thawed clear of snow; but the cold soft peril yet\n","lay upon its flanks thick enough for a wintry plunge of ten feet, or may\n","be fifty where the edge of the causeway fell over to the lower furrows\n","of the ravine. It was a matter of policy to go with caution, and a thing\n","of some moment to hear the thud and splintering of little distant\n","icefalls about one in the darkness. Now and again a cold arrow of wind\n","would sing down from the frosty peaks above or jerk with a squiggle of\n","laughter among the fallen slabs in the valley. And these were the only\n","voices to prick me on through a dreariness lonely as death. I knew the road, but not its night terrors. Passing along it some days\n","before in the glory of sunshine, broad paddocks and islands of green had\n","comforted the shattered white ruin of the place, and I had traversed it\n","merely as a magnificent episode in the indifferent history of my life. Now, as it seemed, I became one with it--an awful waif of solemnity, a\n","thing apart from mankind and its warm intercourse and ruddy inn doors, a\n","spectral anomaly, whose austere epitaph was once writ upon the snow\n","coating some fallen slab of those glimmering about me. I thought the\n","whole gorge smelt of tombs, like the vault of a cathedral. I thought, in\n","the incomprehensible low moaning sound that ever and again seemed to eddy\n","about me when the wind had swooped and passed, that I recognised the\n","forlorn voices of brother spirits long since dead and forgotten of the\n","world. Suddenly I felt the sweat cold under the knapsack that swung upon my\n","back; stopped, faced about and became human again. Ridge over ridge\n","to my right the mountain summits fell away against a fathomless sky; and\n","topping the furthermost was a little paring of silver light, the coronet\n","of the rising moon. But the glory of the full orb was in the retrospect;\n","for, closing the savage vista of the ravine, stood up far away a cluster\n","of jagged pinnacles--opal, translucent, lustrous as the peaks of icebergs\n","that are the frozen music of the sea. It was the toothed summit of the Aiguille Verte, now prosaically bathed\n","in the light of the full moon; but to me, looking from that grim and\n","passionless hollow, it stood for the white hand of God lifted in menace\n","to the evil spirits of the glen. I drank my fill of the good sight, and then turned me to my tramp again\n","with a freshness in my throat as though it had gulped a glass of\n","champagne. Presently I knew myself descending, leaving, as I felt rather\n","than saw, the stark horror of the gorge and its glimmering snow patches\n","above me. Puffs of a warmer air purred past my face with little friendly\n","sighs of welcome, and the hum of a far-off torrent struck like a wedge\n","into the indurated fibre of the night. As I dropped, however, the\n","mountain heads grew up against the moon, and withheld the comfort of her\n","radiance; and it was not until the whimper of the torrent had quickened\n","about me to a plunging roar, and my foot was on the striding bridge that\n","took its waters at a step, that her light broke through a topmost cleft\n","in the hills, and made glory of the leaping thunder that crashed beneath\n","my feet. Thereafter all was peace. The road led downwards into a broadening\n","valley, where the smell of flowers came about me, and the mountain walls\n","withdrew and were no longer overwhelming. The slope eased off, dipping\n","and rising no more than a ground swell; and by-and-by I was on a level\n","track that ran straight as a stretched ribbon and was reasonable to my\n","tired feet. Now the first dusky chalets of the hamlet of Bel-Oiseau straggled towards\n","me, and it was music in my ears to hear the cattle blow and rattle in\n","their stalls under the sleeping lofts as I passed outside in the\n","moonlight. Five minutes more, and the great zinc onion on the spire of\n","the church glistened towards me, and I was in the heart of the silent\n","village. From the deep green shadow cast by the graveyard wall, heavily\n","buttressed against avalanches, a form wriggled out into the moonlight\n","and fell with a dusty thud at my feet, mowing and chopping at the air\n","with its aimless claws. I started back with a sudden jerk of my pulses. The thing was horrible by reason of its inarticulate voice, which issued\n","from the shapeless folds of its writhings like the wet gutturizing of a\n","back-broken horse. Instinct with repulsion, I stood a moment dismayed,\n","when light flashed from an open doorway a dozen yards further down the\n","street, and a woman ran across to the prostrate form. \"Up, graceless one!\" she cried; \"and carry thy seven devils within\n","doors!\" The figure gathered itself together at her voice, and stood in an angle\n","of the buttresses quaking and shielding its eyes with two gaunt arms. \"Can I not exchange a word with Mere Pettit,\" scolded the woman, \"but\n","thou must sneak from behind my back on thy crazed moon-hunting?\" \"Pity, pity,\" moaned the figure; and then the woman noticed me, and\n","dropped a curtsy. \"Pardon,\" she said; \"but he has been affronting Monsieur with his\n","antics?\" \"He is stricken, Madame?\" \"Ah, yes, Monsieur. Holy Mother, but how stricken!\" \"It is sad.\" \"Monsieur knows not how sad. It is so always, but most a great deal when\n","the moon is full. He was a good lad once.\" Monsieur puts his hand in his pocket. Madame hears the clink of coin and\n","touches the enclosed fingers with her own delicately. Monsieur withdraws\n","his hand empty. \"Pardon, Madame.\" \"Monsieur has the courage of a gentleman. Come, Camille, little fool! a\n","sweet good-night to Monsieur.\" \"Stay, Madame. I have walked far and am weary. Is there an hotel in\n","Bel-Oiseau?\" \"Monsieur is jesting. We are but a hundred of poor chalets.\" \"An auberge, then--a cabaret--anything?\" \"_Les Trois Chevres_. It is not for such as you.\" \"Is it, then, that I must toil onwards to Chatelard?\" \"Monsieur does not know? The _Hotel Royal_ was burned to the walls six\n","months since.\" \"It follows that I must lie in the fields.\" Madame hesitates, ponders, and makes up her mind. \"I keep Monsieur talking, and the night wind is sharp from the snow. It\n","is ill for a heated skin, and one should be indoors. I have a bedroom\n","that is at Monsieur's disposition, if Monsieur will condescend?\" Monsieur will condescend. Monsieur would condescend to a loft and a truss\n","of straw, in default of the neat little chilly chamber that is allotted\n","him, so sick are his very limbs with long tramping, and so uninviting\n","figures the further stretch in the moonlight to Chatelard, with its\n","burnt-out carcase of an hotel. This is how I came to quarter myself on Madame Barbiere and her idiot\n","son, and how I ultimately learned from the lips of the latter the strange\n","story of his own immediate fall from reason and the dear light of\n","intellect. *       *       *       *       *\n","\n","By day Camille Barbiere proved to be a young man, some five and twenty\n","years of age, of a handsome and impressive exterior. His dark hair\n","lay close about his well-shaped head; his features were regular and cut\n","bold as an Etruscan cameo; his limbs were elastic and moulded into the\n","supple finish of one whose life has not been set upon level roads. At a\n","speculative distance he appeared a straight specimen of a Burgundian\n","youth--sinewy, clean-formed, and graceful, though slender to gauntness;\n","and it was only on nearer contact that one marvelled to see the soul die\n","out of him, as a face set in the shadow of leafage resol\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"c9dde4b1"},"source":[""],"id":"c9dde4b1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
