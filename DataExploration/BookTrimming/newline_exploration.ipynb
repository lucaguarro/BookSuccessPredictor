CHARLES. Prince of Navarre my honourable brother,\\n   Prince Condy, and my good Lord Admirall,\\n   wishe this union and religious league,\\n   Knit in these hands, thus joyn'd in nuptiall rites,\\n   May not desolve, till death desolve our lives,\\n   And that the native sparkes of princely love,\\n   That kindled first this motion in our hearts,\\n   May still be feweld in our progenye. NAVAREE. The many favours which your grace has showne,\\n   From time to time, but specially in this,\\n   Shall binde me ever to your highnes will,\\n   In what Queen Mother or your grace commands. QUEENE MOTHER. Thanks sonne Navarre, you see we love you well,\\n   That linke you in mariage with our daughter heer:\\n   And as you know, our difference in Religion\\n   Might be a meanes to crosse you in your love. CHARLES. Well Madam, let that rest:\\n   And now my Lords the mariage rites perfourm'd,\\n   We think it good to goe and consumate\\n   The rest, with hearing of an holy Masse:\\n   Sister, I think your selfe will beare us company. QUEENE MARGARET. I will my good Lord. CHARLES. The rest that will not goe (my Lords) may stay:\\n   Come Mother,\\n   Let us goe to honor this solemnitie. QUEENE MOTHER. Which Ile desolve with bloud and crueltie. [Aside.] Exit [Charles] the King, Queene Mother, and [Margaret]\\n        the Queene of Navar [with others], and manet Navar,\\n        the Prince of Condy, and the Lord high Admirall. NAVARRE. Prince Condy and my good Lord Admiral,\\n   Now Guise may storme but does us little hurt:\\n   Having the King, Queene Mother on our side,\\n   To stop the mallice of his envious heart,\\n   That seekes to murder all the Protestants:\\n   Have you not heard of late how he decreed,\\n   If that the King had given consent thereto,\\n   That all the protestants that are in Paris,\\n   Should have been murdered the other night? ADMIRALL. My Lord I mervaile that th'aspiring Guise\\n   Dares once adventure without the Kings assent,\\n   To meddle or attempt such dangerous things. CONDY. My Lord you need not mervaile at the Guise,\\n   For what he doth the Pope will ratifie:\\n   In murder, mischeefe, or in tiranny. NAVARRE. But he that sits and rules above the clowdes,\\n   Doth heare and see the praiers of the just:\\n   And will revenge the bloud of innocents,\\n   That Guise hath slaine by treason of his heart,\\n   And brought by murder to their timeles ends. ADMIRALL. My Lord, but did you mark the Cardinall\\n   The Guises brother, and the Duke Dumain:\\n   How they did storme at these your nuptiall rites,\\n   Because the house of Burbon now comes in,\\n   And joynes your lineage to the crowne of France? NAVARRE. And thats the cause that Guise so frowns at us,\\n   And beates his braines to catch us in his trap,\\n   Which he hath pitcht within his deadly toyle. Come my Lords lets go to the Church and pray,\\n   That God may still defend the right of France:\\n   And make his Gospel flourish in this land. Exeunt. [Scene ii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the Duke of Guise. GUISE. If ever Hymen lowr'd at marriage rites,\\n   And had his alters decks with duskie lightes:\\n   If ever sunne stainde heaven with bloudy clowdes,\\n   And made it look with terrour on the worlde:\\n   If ever day were turnde to ugly night,\\n   And night made semblance of the hue of hell,\\n   This day, this houre, this fatall night,\\n   Shall fully shew the fury of them all. Apothecarie.--\\n\\n        Enter the Pothecarie. POTHECARIE. My Lord. GUISE. Now shall I prove and guerdon to the ful,\\n   The love thou bear'st unto the house of Guise:\\n   Where are those perfumed gloves which late I sent\\n   To be poysoned, hast thou done them? speake,\\n   Will every savour breed a pangue of death? POTHECARIE. See where they be my Lord, and he that smelles\\n   but to them, dyes. GUISE. Then thou remainest resolute. POTHECARIE. I am my Lord, in what your grace commaundes till death. GUISE. Thankes my good freend, I wil requite thy love. Goe then, present them to the Queene Navarre:\\n   For she is that huge blemish in our eye,\\n   That makes these upstart heresies in Fraunce:\\n   Be gone my freend, present them to her straite. Souldyer.--\\n\\n        Exit Pothecaier. Enter a Souldier. SOULDIER. My Lord. GUISE. Now come thou forth and play thy tragick part,\\n   Stand in some window opening neere the street,\\n   And when thou seest the Admirall ride by,\\n   Discharge thy musket and perfourme his death:\\n   And then Ile guerdon thee with store of crownes. SOULDIER. I will my Lord. Exit Souldier. GUISE. Now Guise, begin those deepe ingendred thoughts\\n   To burst abroad, those never dying flames,\\n   Which cannot be extinguisht but by bloud. Oft have I leveld, and at last have learnd,\\n   That perill is the cheefest way to happines,\\n   And resolution honors fairest aime. What glory is there in a common good,\\n   That hanges for every peasant to atchive? That like I best that flyes beyond my reach. Set me to scale the high Peramides,\\n   And thereon set the Diadem of Fraunce,\\n   Ile either rend it with my nayles to naught,\\n   Or mount the top with my aspiring winges,\\n   Although my downfall be the deepest hell. For this, I wake, when others think I sleepe,\\n   For this, I waite, that scorn attendance else:\\n   For this, my quenchles thirst whereon I builde,\\n   Hath often pleaded kindred to the King. For this, this head, this heart, this hand and sworde,\\n   Contrive, imagine and fully execute\\n   Matters of importe, aimed at by many,\\n   Yet understoode by none. For this, hath heaven engendred me of earth,\\n   For this, the earth sustaines my bodies weight,\\n   And with this wait Ile counterpoise a Crowne,\\n   Or with seditions weary all the worlde:\\n   For this, from Spaine the stately Catholic\\n   Sends Indian golde to coyne me French ecues:\\n   For this have I a largesse from the Pope,\\n   A pension and a dispensation too:\\n   And by that priviledge to worke upon,\\n   My policye hath framde religion. Religion: O Diabole. Fye, I am ashamde, how ever that I seeme,\\n   To think a word of such a simple sound,\\n   Of so great matter should be made the ground. The gentle King whose pleasure uncontrolde,\\n   Weakneth his body, and will waste his Realme,\\n   If I repaire not what he ruinates:\\n   Him as a childe I dayly winne with words,\\n   So that for proofe, he barely beares the name:\\n   I execute, and he sustaines the blame. The Mother Queene workes wonders for my sake,\\n   And in my love entombes the hope of Fraunce:\\n   Rifling the bowels of her treasurie,\\n   To supply my wants and necessitie. Paris hath full five hundred Colledges,\\n   As Monestaries, Priories, Abbyes and halles,\\n   Wherein are thirtie thousand able men,\\n   Besides a thousand sturdy student Catholicks,\\n   And more: of my knowledge in one cloyster keep,\\n   Five hundred fatte Franciscan Fryers and priestes. All this and more, if more may be comprisde,\\n   To bring the will of our desires to end. Then Guise,\\n   Since thou hast all the Cardes within thy hands\\n   To shuffle or to cut, take this as surest thing:\\n   That right or wrong, thou deal'st thy selfe a King. I but, Navarre. Tis but a nook of France. Sufficient yet for such a pettie King:\\n   That with a rablement of his hereticks,\\n   Blindes Europs eyes and troubleth our estate:\\n   Him will we--\\n\\n        Pointing to his Sworde. But first lets follow those in France. That hinder our possession to the crowne:\\n   As Caesar to his souldiers, so say I:\\n   Those that hate me, will I learn to loath. Give me a look, that when I bend the browes,\\n   Pale death may walke in furrowes of my face:\\n   A hand, that with a graspe may gripe the world,\\n   An eare, to heare what my detractors say,\\n   A royall seate, a scepter and a crowne:\\n   That those which doe behold them may become\\n   As men that stand and gase against the Sunne. The plot is laide, and things shall come to passe,\\n   Where resolution strives for victory. Exit. [Scene iii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the King of Navar and Queen [Margaret], and his [olde]\\n        Mother Queen [of Navarre], the Prince of Condy, the Admirall,\\n        and the Pothecary with the gloves, and gives them to the olde\\n        Queene. POTHECARIE. Maddame, I beseech your grace to except this simple gift. OLD QUEENE. Thanks my good freend, holde, take thou this reward. POTHECARIE. I humbly thank your Majestie. Exit Pothecary. OLD QUEENE. Me thinkes the gloves have a very strong perfume,\\n   The sent whereof doth make my head to ake. NAVARRE. Doth not your grace know the man that gave them you? OLD QUEENE. Not wel, but do remember such a man. ADMIRALL. Your grace was ill advisde to take them then,\\n   Considering of these dangerous times. OLD QUEENE. Help sonne Navarre, I am poysoned. QUEENE MARGARET. The heavens forbid your highnes such mishap. NAVARRE. The late suspition of the Duke of Guise,\\n   Might well have moved your highnes to beware\\n   How you did meddle with such dangerous giftes. QUEENE MARGARET. Too late it is my Lord if that be true\\n   To blame her highnes, but I hope it be\\n   Only some naturall passion makes her sicke. OLD QUEENE. O no, sweet Margaret, the fatall poyson\\n   Doth work within my heart, my brain pan breakes,\\n   My heart doth faint, I dye. She dyes. NAVARRE. My Mother poysoned heere before my face:\\n   O gracious God, what times are these? O graunt sweet God my daies may end with hers,\\n   That I with her may dye and live againe. QUEENE MARGARET. Let not this heavy chaunce my dearest Lord,\\n   (For whose effects my soule is massacred)\\n   Infect thy gracious brest with fresh supply,\\n   To agravate our sodaine miserie. ADMIRALL. Come my Lords let us beare her body hence,\\n   And see it honoured with just solemnitie. As they are going, [enter] the Souldier [above, who] dischargeth\\n        his musket at the Lord Admirall [and exit]. CONDY. What are you hurt my Lord high Admiral? ADMIRALL. I my good Lord, shot through the arme. NAVARRE. We are betraide, come my Lords, and let us goe tell\\n   the King of this. ADMIRALL. These are the cursed Guisians that doe seeke our death. Oh fatall was this mariage to us all. They beare away the [olde] Queene [of Navarre] and goe out. [Scene iv]\\n\\n\\n        Enter [Charles] the King, [Catherine] the Queene Mother, Duke of Guise,\\n        Duke Anjou, Duke Demayne [and Cossin, Captain of the Kings Guard]. QUEENE MOTHER. My noble sonne, and princely Duke of Guise,\\n   Now have we got the fatall stragling deere,\\n   Within the compasse of a deadly toyle,\\n   And as we late decreed we may perfourme. CHARLES. Madam, it wilbe noted through the world,\\n   An action bloudy and tirannicall:\\n   Cheefely since under safetie of our word,\\n   They justly challenge their protection:\\n   Besides my heart relentes that noble men,\\n   Onely corrupted in religion,\\n   Ladies of honor, Knightes and Gentlemen,\\n   Should for their conscience taste such rutheles ends. ANJOY. Though gentle minces should pittie others paines,\\n   Yet will the wisest note their proper greefes:\\n   And rather seeke to scourge their enemies,\\n   Then be themselves base subjects to the whip. GUISE. Me thinkes my Lord, Anjoy hath well advisde\\n   Your highnes to consider of the thing,\\n   And rather chuse to seek your countries good,\\n   Then pittie or releeve these upstart hereticks. QUEENE MOTHER. I hope these reasons mayserve my princely, Sonne,\\n   To have some care for feare of enemies. CHARLES. Well Madam, I referre it to your Majestie,\\n   And to my Nephew heere the Duke of Guise:\\n   What you determine, I will ratifie. QUEENE MOTHER. Thankes to my princely sonne, then tell me Guise,\\n   What order wil you set downe for the Massacre? GUISE. Thus Madame. They that shalbe actors in this Massacre,\\n   Shall weare white crosses on their Burgonets,\\n   And tye white linnen scarfes about their armes. He that wantes these, and is suspect of heresie,\\n   Shall dye, or be he King or Emperour. Then Ile have a peale of ordinance shot from the tower,\\n   At which they all shall issue out and set the streetes. And then the watchword being given, a bell shall ring,\\n   Which when they heare, they shall begin to kill:\\n   And never cease untill that bell shall cease,\\n   Then breath a while. Enter the Admirals man. CHARLES. How now fellow, what newes? MAN. And it please your grace the Lord high Admirall,\\n   Riding the streetes was traiterously shot,\\n   And most humbly intreates your Majestie\\n   To visite him sick in his bed. CHARLES. Messenger, tell him I will see him straite. Exit Messenger. What shall we doe now with the Admirall? QUEENE MOTHER. Your Majesty had best goe visite him,\\n   And make a shew as if all were well. CHARLES. Content, I will goe visite the Admirall. GUISE. And I will goe take order for his death. Exit Guise. Enter the Admirall in his bed. CHARLES. How fares it with my Lord high Admiral,\\n   Hath he been hurt with villaines in the street? I vow and sweare as I am King of France,\\n   To finde and to repay the man with death:\\n   With death delay'd and torments never usde,\\n   That durst presume for hope of any gaine,\\n   To hurt the noble man his sovereign loves. ADMIRALL. Ah my good Lord, these are the Guisians,\\n   That seeke to massacre our guiltles lives. CHARLES. Assure your selfe my good Lord Admirall,\\n   I deepely sorrow for your trecherous wrong:\\n   And that I am not more secure my selfe,\\n   Then I am carefull you should be preserved. Cossin, take twenty of our strongest guarde,\\n   And under your direction see they keep\\n   All trecherous violence from our noble freend,\\n   Repaying all attempts with present death,\\n   Upon the cursed breakers of our peace. And so be pacient good Lord Admirall,\\n   And every hower I will visite you. Exeunt omnes. [Scene v]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Guise, Anjoy, Dumaine, Gonzago, Retes, Montsorrell, and\\n        Souldiers to the massacre. GUISE. Anjoy, Dumaine, Gonzago, Retes, sweare by\\n   The argent crosses on your burgonets,\\n   To kill all that you suspect of heresie. DUMAINE. I sweare by this to be unmercifull. ANJOY. I am disguisde and none nows who I am,\\n   And therfore meane to murder all I meet. GONZAGO. And so will I.\\n\\n   RETES. And I.\\n\\n   GUISE. Away then, break into the Admirals house. GETES. I let the Admirall be first dispatcht. GUISE. The Admirall,\\n   Cheefe standard bearer to the Lutheranes,\\n   Shall in the entrance of this Massacre,\\n   Be murdered in his bed. Gonzago conduct them hither, and then\\n   Beset his house that not a man may live. ANJOY. That charge is mine. Swizers keepe you the streetes,\\n   And at ech corner shall the Kings garde stand. GONZAGO. Come sirs follow me. Exit Gonzago and others with him. ANJOY. Cossin, the Captaine of the Admirals guarde,\\n   Plac'd by my brother, will betray his Lord:\\n   Now Guise shall catholiques flourish once againe,\\n   The head being of, the members cannot stand. RETES. But look my Lord, ther's some in the Admirals house. Enter [above Gonzago and others] into the Admirals house,\\n        and he in his bed. ANJOY. In lucky time, come let us keep this lane,\\n   And slay his servants that shall issue out. GONZAGO. Where is the Admirall? ADMIRALL. O let me pray before I dye. GONZAGO. Then pray unto our Ladye, kisse this crosse. Stab him. ADMIRALL. O God forgive my sins. GUISE. What, is he dead Gonzago? GONZAGO. I my Lord. GUISE. Then throw him down. [The body is thrown down. Exeunt Gonzago and rest above.] ANJOY. Now cosin view him well,\\n   It may be it is some other, and he escapte. GUISE. Cosin tis he, I know him by his look. See where my Souldier shot him through the arm. He mist him neer, but we have strook him now. Ah base Shatillian and degenerate,\\n   Cheef standard bearer to the Lutheranes,\\n   Thus in despite of thy Religion,\\n   The Duke of Guise stampes on thy liveles bulke. Away with him, cut of his head and handes,\\n   And send them for a present to the Pope:\\n   And when this just revenge is finished,\\n   Unto mount Faucon will we dragge his coarse:\\n   And he that living hated so the crosse,\\n   Shall being dead, be hangd thereon in chaines. GUISE. Anjoy, Gonzago, Retes, if that you three,\\n   Will be as resolute as I and Dumaine:\\n   There shall not a Hugonet breath in France. ANJOY. I sweare by this crosse, wee'l not be partiall,\\n   But slay as many as we can come neer. GUISE. Mountsorrett, go and shoote the ordinance of,\\n   That they which have already set the street\\n   May know their watchword, and then tole the bell,\\n   And so lets forward to the Massacre. MOUNTSORRELL. I will my Lord. Exit Mountsorrell. GUISE. And now my Lords let us closely to our busines. ANJOY. Anjoy will follow thee. DUMAINE. And so will Dumaine. The ordinance being shot of, the bell tolles. GUISE. Come then, lets away. Exeunt. The Guise enters againe, with all the rest, with their Swords drawne,\\n        chasing the Protestants. GUISE. Tue, tue, tue,\\n   Let none escape, murder the Hugonets. ANJOY. Kill them, kill them. Exeunt. Enter Loreine running, the Guise and the rest pursuing him. GUISE. Loreine, Loreine, follow Loreine.. Sirra,\\n   Are you a preacher of these heresies? LOREINE. I am a preacher of the word of God,\\n   And thou a traitor to thy soule and him. GUISE. Dearely beloved brother, thus tis written. He stabs him. ANJOY. Stay my Lord, let me begin the psalme. GUISE. Come dragge him away and throw him in a ditch. Exeunt [omnes]. [Scene vi]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Mountsorrell and knocks at Serouns doore. SEROUNS WIFE. Who is't that knocks there? [Within.] MOUNTSORRELL. Mountsorrett from the Duke of Guise. SEROUNS WIFE. Husband come down, heer's one would speak with\\n   you from the Duke of Guise. Enter Seroune. SEROUNE. To speek with me from such a man as he? MOUNTSORRELL. I, I, for this Seroune, and thou shalt ha't. Shewing his dagger. SEROUNE. O let me pray before I take my death. MOUNTSORRELL. Despatch then quickly. SEROUNE. O Christ my Saviour--\\n\\n   MOUNTSORRELL. Christ, villaine? Why, darst thou presume to call on Christ,\\n   Without the intercession of some Saint? Sanctus Jacobus hee was my Saint, pray to him. SEROUNE. O let me pray unto my God. MOUNTSORRELL. Then take this with you. Stab him [and he falls within and dies]. Exit. [Scene vii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Ramus in his studie. RAMUS. What fearfull cries come from the river Sene,\\n   That fright poore Ramus sitting at his book? I feare the Guisians have past the bridge,\\n   And meane once more to menace me. Enter Taleus. TALEUS. Flye Ramus flye, if thou wilt save thy life. RAMUS. Tell me Taleus, wherfore should I flye? TALEUS. The Guisians are hard at thy doore,\\n   And meane to murder us:\\n   Harke, harke they come, Ile leap out at the window. [Runs out from studie.] RAMUS. Sweet Taleus stay. Enter Gonzago and Retes. GONZAGO. Who goes there? RETES. Tis Taleus, Ramus bedfellow. GONZAGO. What art thou? TALEUS. I am as Ramus is, a Christian. RETES. O let him goe, he is a catholick. Exit Taleus. Enter Ramus [out of his studie]. GONZAGO. Come Ramus, more golde, or thou shalt have the stabbe. RAMUS. Alas I am a scholler, how should I have golde? All that I have is but my stipend from the King,\\n   Which is no sooner receiv'd but it is spent. Enter the Guise and Anjoy [, Dumaine, Mountsorrell,\\n        with soldiers]. ANJOY. Whom have you there? RETES. Tis Ramus, the Kings professor of Logick. GUISE. Stab him. RAMUS. O good my Lord,\\n   Wherein hath Ramus been so offencious? GUISE. Marry sir, in having a smack in all,\\n   And yet didst never sound any thing to the depth. Was it not thou that scoff'dst the Organon,\\n   And said it was a heape of vanities? He that will be a flat decotamest,\\n   And seen in nothing but Epitomies:\\n   Is in your judgment thought a learned man. And he forsooth must goe and preach in Germany:\\n   Excepting against Doctors actions,\\n   And ipse dixi with this quidditie,\\n   Argumentum testimonis est in arte partialis. To contradict which, I say Ramus shall dye:\\n   How answere you that? your nego argumentum\\n   Cannot serve, Sirrah, kill him. RAMUS. O good my Lord, let me but speak a word. ANJOY. Well, say on. RAMUS. Not for my life doe I desire this pause,\\n   But in my latter houre to purge my selfe,\\n   In that I know the things that I have wrote,\\n   Which as I heare one Shekins takes it ill,\\n   Because my places being but three, contain all his:\\n   I knew the Organon to be confusde,\\n   And I reduc'd it into better forme. And this for Aristotle will I say,\\n   That he that despiseth him, can nere\\n   Be good in Logick or Philosophie. And thats because the blockish Sorbonests\\n   Attribute as much unto their workes,\\n   As to the service of the eternall God. GUISE. Why suffer you that peasant to declaime? Stab him I say and send him to his freends in hell. ANJOY. Nere was there Colliars sonne so full of pride. Kill him. [Close the studie.] GUISE. My Lord Anjoy, there are a hundred Protestants,\\n   Which we have chaste into the river Sene,\\n   That swim about and so preserve their lives:\\n   How may we doe? I feare me they will live. DUMAINE. Goe place some men upon the bridge,\\n   With bowes and cartes to shoot at them they see,\\n   And sinke them in the river as they swim. GUISE. Tis well advisde Dumain, goe see it done.

My Lords of Poland I must needs confesse,\\n   The offer of your Prince Elector's, farre\\n   Beyond the reach of my desertes:\\n   For Poland is as I have been enformde,\\n   A martiall people, worthy such a King,\\n   As hath sufficient counsaile in himselfe,\\n   To lighten doubts and frustrate subtile foes.

With Poland therfore must I covenant thus,\\n   That if by death of Charles, the diadem\\n   Of France be cast on me, then with your leaves\\n   I may retire me to my native home.

Oh twill corrupt the water, and the water the fish, and the\\n   fish our selves when we eate them. 1. Then throw him into the ditch. 2. No, no, to decide all doubts, be rulde by me, lets hang him\\n   upon this tree. 1. Agreede. They hang him. Enter the Duke of Guise, and Queene Mother, and the\\n        Cardinall [of Loraine].

My Lord of Loraine have you marks of late,\\n   How Charles our sonne begins for to lament\\n   For the late nights worke which my Lord of Guise\\n   Did make in Paris amongst the Hugonites? CARDINALL. Madam, I have heard him solemnly vow,\\n   With the rebellious King of Navarre,\\n   For to revenge their deaths upon us all. QUEENE MOTHER. I, but my Lord, let me alone for that,\\n   For Katherine must have her will in France:\\n   As I doe live, so surely shall he dye,\\n   And Henry then shall weare the diadem. And if he grudge or crosse his Mothers will,\\n   Ile disinherite him and all the rest:\\n   For Ile rule France, but they shall weare the crowne:\\n   And if they storme, I then may pull them downe.

Had late been plucks from out faire Cupids wing:\\n   That it might print these lines within his heart. Enter the Guise. GUISE. What, all alone my love, and writing too:\\n   I prethee say to whome thou writes? DUCHESSE. To such a one, as when she reads my lines,\\n   Will laugh I feare me at their good aray. GUISE. I pray thee let me see. DUCHESSE. O no my Lord, a woman only must\\n   Partake the secrets of my heart. GUISE. But Madam I must see. He takes it. Are these your secrets that no man must know? DUCHESSE. O pardon me my Lord. GUISE. Thou trothles and unjust, what lines are these? Am I growne olde, or is thy lust growne yong,\\n   Or hath my love been so obscurde in thee,\\n   That others need to comment on my text? Is all my love forgot which helde thee deare? I, dearer then the apple of mine eye? Is Guises glory but a clowdy mist,\\n   In sight and judgement of thy lustfull eye? Mor du, were not the fruit within thy wombe,\\n   On whose encrease I set some longing hope:\\n   This wrathfull hand should strike thee to the hart\\n   Hence strumpet, hide thy head for shame,\\n   And fly my presence if thou look'st to live.

Now Lords, since in a quarrell just and right,\\n   We undertake to mannage these our warres\\n   Against the proud disturbers of the faith,\\n   I meane the Guise, the Pope, and King of Spaine,\\n   Who set themselves to tread us under foot,\\n   And rend our true religion from this land:\\n   But for you know our quarrell is no more,\\n   But to defend their strange inventions,\\n   Which they will put us to with sword and fire:\\n   We must with resolute minces resolve to fight,\\n   In honor of our God and countries good. Spaine is the counsell chamber of the pope,\\n   Spaine is the place where he makes peace and warre,\\n   And Guise for Spaine hath now incenst the King,\\n   To send his power to meet us in the field. BARTUS. Then in this bloudy brunt they may beholde,\\n   The sole endevour of your princely care,\\n   To plant the true succession of the faith,\\n   In spite of Spaine and all his heresies. NAVARRE. The power of vengeance now implants it selfe,\\n   Upon the hauty mountains of my brest:\\n   Plaies with her goary coulours of revenge,\\n   Whom I respect as leaves of boasting greene,\\n   That change their coulour when the winter comes,\\n   When I shall vaunt as victor in revenge.

My Lord, as by our scoutes we understande,\\n   A mighty army comes from France with speed:\\n   Which is already mustered in the land,\\n   And meanesto meet your highnes in the field. NAVARRE. In Gods name, let them come. This is the Guise that hath incenst the King,\\n   To leavy armes and make these civill broyles:\\n   But canst thou tell me who is their generall? MESSENGER. Not yet my Lord, for thereon doe they stay:\\n   But as report doth goe, the Duke of Joyeux\\n   Hath made great sute unto the King therfore. NAVARRE. It will not countervaile his paines I hope,\\n   I would the Guise in his steed might have come,\\n   But he doth lurke within his drousie couch,\\n   And makes his footstoole on securitie:\\n   So he be safe he cares not what becomes,\\n   Of King or Country, no not for them both. But come my Lords, let us away with speed,\\n   And place our selves in order for the fight. Exeunt.

How kindely Cosin of Guise you and your wife\\n   Doe both salute our lovely Minions. He makes hornes at the Guise. Remember you the letter gentle sir,\\n   Which your wife writ to my deare Minion,\\n   And her chosen freend? GUISE. How now my Lord, faith this is more then need,\\n   Am I to be thus jested at and scornde? Tis more then kingly or Emperious. And sure if all the proudest kings beside\\n   In Christendome, should beare me such derision,\\n   They should know I scornde them and their mockes. I love your Minions? dote on them your selfe,\\n   I know none els but hordes them in disgrace:\\n   And heer by all the Saints in heaven I sweare,\\n   That villain for whom I beare this deep disgrace,\\n   Even for your words that have incenst me so,\\n   Shall buy that strumpets favour with his blood,\\n   Whether he have dishonoured me or no. Par la mor du, Il mora. Exit. KING. Beleeve me, Epernoune this jest bites sore. EPERNOUNE. My Lord, twere good to make them frends,\\n   For his othes are seldome spent in vaine. Enter Mugeroun. KING. How now Mugeroun, metst thou not the Guise at the doore? MUGEROUN. Not I my Lord, what if I had? KING. Marry if thou hadst, thou mightst have had the stab,\\n   For he hath solemnely sworne thy death. MUGEROUN. I may be stabd, and live till he be dead,\\n   But wherfore beares he me such deadly hate? KING. Because his wife beares thee such kindely love. MUGEROUN. If that be all, the next time that I meet her,\\n   Ile make her shake off love with her heeles. But which way is he gone? Ile goe take a walk\\n   On purpose from the Court to meet with him. Exit. KING. I like not this, come Epernoune\\n   Lets goe seek the Duke and make them freends. Exeunt.

The Duke is slaine and all his power dispearst,\\n   And we are grac'd with wreathes of victory:\\n   Thus God we see doth ever guide the right,\\n   To make his glory great upon the earth. BARTUS. The terrour of this happy victory,\\n   I hope will make the King surcease his hate:\\n   And either never mannage army more,\\n   Or else employ them in some better cause. NAVARRE. How many noble men have lost their lives,\\n   In prosecution of these quell armes,\\n   Is ruth and almost death to call to mince:\\n   Put God we know will alwaies put them downe,\\n   That lift themselves against the perfect truth,\\n   Which Ile maintaine as long as life doth last:\\n   And with the Queene of England joyne my force,\\n   To beat the papall Monarck from our lands,\\n   And keep those relicks from our countries coastes. Come my Lords, now that the storme is overpass,\\n   Let us away with triumph to our tents. Exeunt. [Scene xvii]\\n\\n\\n      Enter a Souldier. SOULDIER. Sir, to you sir, that dare make the Duke a cuckolde,\\n   and use a counterfeite key to his privie Chamber doore: And\\n   although you take out nothing but your owne, yet you put in\\n   that which displeaseth him, and so forestall his market, and set up\\n   your standing where you should not: and whereas tree is your\\n   Landlord, you would take upon you to be his, and tyll the ground\\n   that he himself should occupy, which is his own free land. If it be\\n   not too free there's the question: and though I come not to take\\n   possession (as I would I might) yet I meane to keepe you out,\\n   which I will if this geare horde: what are ye come so soone? have at ye sir.

My Lord of Guise, we understand that you\\n   Have gathered a power of men. What your intent is yet we cannot learn,\\n   But we presume it is not for our good. GUISE. Why I am no traitor to the crowne of France. What I have done tis for the Gospel's sake. EPERNOUNE. Nay for the Popes sake, and shine owne benefite. What Peere in France but thou (aspiring Guise)\\n   Durst be in armes without the Kings consent? I challenge thee for treason in the cause. GUISE. Oh base Epernoune, were not his highnes heere,\\n   Thou shouldst perceive the Duke of Guise is mov'd. KING. Be patient Guise and threat not Epernoune,\\n   Least thou perceive the King of France be mov'd. GUISE. Why? I am a Prince of the Valoyses line,\\n   Therfore an enemy to the Burbonites. I am a juror in the holy league,\\n   And therfore hated of the Protestants. What should I doe but stand upon my guarde? And being able, Ile keep an hoast in pay. EPERNOUNE. Thou able to maintaine an hoast in pay,\\n   That livest by forraine exhibition? The Pope and King of Spaine are thy good frends,\\n   Else all France knowes how poor a Duke thou art. KING. I, those are they that feed him with their golde,\\n   To countermaund our will and check our freends. GUISE. My Lord, to speak more plainely, thus it is:\\n   Being animated by Religious zeale,\\n   I meane to muster all the power I can,\\n   To overthrow those factious Puritans:\\n   And know, the Pope will sell his triple crowne,\\n   I, and the catholick Philip King of Spaine,\\n   Ere I shall want, will cause his Indians,\\n   To rip the golden bowels of America. Navarre that cloakes them underneath his wings,\\n   Shall feele the house of Lorayne is his foe:\\n   Your highnes need not feare mine armies force,\\n   Tis for your safetie and your enemies wrack. KING. Guise, weare our crowne, and be thou King of France,\\n   And as Dictator make or warre or peace,\\n   Whilste I cry placet like a Senator. I cannot brook thy hauty insolence,\\n   Dismisse thy campe or else by our Edict,\\n   Be thou proclaimde a traitor throughout France. GUISE. The choyse is hard, I must dissemble. [Aside.] My Lord, in token of my true humilitie,\\n   And simple meaning to your Majestie,\\n   I kisse your graces hand, and take my leave,\\n   Intending to dislodge my campe with speed. KING. Then farwell Guise, the King and thou art freends. Exit Guise. EPERNOUNE. But trust him not my Lord,\\n   For had your highnesse seene with what a pompe\\n   He entred Paris, and how the Citizens\\n   With gifts and shewes did entertaine him\\n   And promised to be at his commaund:\\n   Nay, they fear'd not to speak in the streetes,\\n   That Guise ch, durst stand in armes against the King,\\n   For not effecting of his holines will. KING. Did they of Paris entertaine him so? Then meanes he present treason to our state. Well, let me alone, whose within there? Enter one with e pen and inke. Make a discharge of all my counsell straite,\\n   And Ile subscribe my name and seale it straight. My head shall be my counsell, they are false:\\n   And Epernoune I will be rulde by thee. EPERNOUNE. My Lord,\\n   I think for safety of your person,\\n   It would be good the Guise were made away,\\n   And so to quite your grace of all suspect. KING. First let us set our hand and seale to this,\\n   And then Ile tell thee what I meane to doe. He writes. So, convey this to the counsell presently. Exit one. And Epernoune though I seeme milde and calme,\\n   Thinke not but I am tragicall within:\\n   Ile secretly convey me unto Bloyse,\\n   For now that Paris takes the Guises parse,\\n   Heere is not staying for the King of France,\\n   Unles he means to be betraide and dye:\\n   But as I live, so sure the Guise shall dye.

My Lord, I am advertised from France,\\n   That the Guise hath taken armes against the King,\\n   And that Paris is revolted from his grace. BARTUS. Then hath your grace fit oportunitie,\\n   To shew your love unto the King of France:\\n   Offering him aide against his enemies,\\n   Which cannot but be thankfully receiv'd. NAVARRE. Bartus, it shall be so, poast then to Fraunce,\\n   And there salute his highnesse in our name,\\n   Assure him all the aide we can provide,\\n   Against the Guisians and their complices.

But are they resolute and armde to kill,\\n   Hating the life and honour of the Guise? CAPTAINE. I warrant you my Lord. [Exit.] KING. Then come proud Guise and heere disgordge thy brest,\\n   Surchargde with surfet of ambitious thoughts:\\n   Breath out that life wherein my death was hid,\\n   And end thy endles treasons with thy death. Enter the Guise [within] and knocketh. GUISE. Holla varlet, hey: Epernoune, where is the King? EPERNOUNE. Mounted his royall Cabonet. GUISE. I prethee tell him that the Guise is heere. EPERNOUNE. And please your grace the Duke of Guise doth crave\\n   Accesse unto your highnes. KING. Let him come in. Come Guise and see thy traiterous guile outreacht,\\n   And perish in the pit thou mad'st for me. The Guise comes to the King. GUISE. Good morrow to your Majestie. KING. Good morrow to my loving Cousin of Guise. How fares it this morning with your excellence? GUISE. I heard your Majestie was scarcely pleasde,\\n   That in the Court I bear so great a traine. KING. They were to blame that said I was displeasde,\\n   And you good Cosin to imagine it. Twere hard with me if I should doubt my kinne,\\n   Or be suspicious of my deerest freends:\\n   Cousin, assure you I am resolute,\\n   Whatever any whisper in mine eares,\\n   Not to suspect disloyaltye in thee,\\n   And so sweet Cuz farwell. Exit King [and Epernoune]. GUISE. So,\\n   Now sues the King for favour to the Guise,\\n   And all his Minions stoup when I commaund:\\n   Why this tis to have an army in the fielde. Now by the holy sacrament I sweare,\\n   As ancient Romanes over their Captive Lords,\\n   So will I triumph over this wanton King,\\n   And he shall follow my proud Chariots wheeles. Now doe I but begin to look about,\\n   And all my former time was spent in vaine:\\n   Holde Sworde,\\n   For in thee is the Guises hope. Enter one of the Murtherers. Villaine, why cost thou look so gastly? speake. 3. O pardon me my Lord of Guise. GUISE. Pardon thee, why what hast thou done? 3. O my Lord, I am one of them that is set to murder you. GUISE. To murder me, villaine? 3. I my Lord, the rest have taine their standings in the next\\n   roome, therefore good my Lord goe not foorth. GUISE. Yet Caesar shall goe forth. Let mean consaits, and baser men feare death,\\n   Tut they are pesants, I am Duke of Guise:\\n   And princes with their lookes ingender feare. 2 MURD. Stand close, he is comming, I know him by his voice. GUISE. As pale as ashes, nay then tis time to look about. ALL. Downe with him, downe with him. They stabbe him. GUISE. Oh I have my death wound, give me leave to speak. 2. Then pray to God, and aske forgivenes of the King. GUISE. Trouble me not, I neare offended him,\\n   Nor will I aske forgivenes of the King. Oh that I have not power to stay my life,\\n   Nor immortalitie to be reveng'd:\\n   To dye by Pesantes, what a greefe is this? Ah Sextus, be reveng'd upon the King,\\n   Philip and Parma, I am slaine for you:\\n   Pope excommunicate, Philip depose,\\n   The wicked branch of curst Valois's line. Vive la messe, perish Hugonets,\\n   Thus Caesar did goe foorth, and thus he dies. He dyes. Enter Captaine of the Guarde. CAPTAINE. What, have you done? Then stay a while and Ile goe call the King,\\n\\n        [Enter King and Epernoune attended.] But see where he comes. My Lord, see where the Guise is slaine. KING. Oh this sweet sight is phisick to my soule,\\n   Goe fetch his sonne for to beholde his death:\\n\\n        [Exit attendant.] Surchargde with guilt of thousand massacres,\\n   Mounser of Loraine sinke away to hell,\\n   In just remembrance of those bloudy broyles,\\n   To which thou didst alure me being alive:\\n   And heere in presence of you all I sweare,\\n   I nere was King of France untill this houre:\\n   This is the traitor that hath spent my golde,\\n   In making forraine warres and cruel broiles. Did he not draw a sorte of English priestes\\n   From Doway to the Seminary at Remes,\\n   To hatch forth treason gainst their naturall Queene? Did he not cause the King of Spaines huge fleete,\\n   To threaten England and to menace me? Did he not injure Mounser thats deceast? Hath he not made me in the Popes defence,\\n   To spend the treasure that should strength my land,\\n   In civill broiles between Navarre and me? Tush, to be short, he meant to make me Munke,\\n   Or else to murder me, and so be King. Let Christian princes that shall heare of this,\\n   (As all the world shall know our Guise is dead)\\n   Rest satisfed with this that heer I sweare,\\n   Nere was there King of France so yoakt as I.\\n\\n   EPERNOUNE. My Lord heer is his sonne. Enter the Guises sonne. KING. Boy, look where your father lyes. YONG GUISE. My father slaine, who hath done this deed? KING. Sirra twas I that slew him, and will slay\\n   Thee too, and thou prove such a traitor. YONG GUISE. Art thou King, and hast done this bloudy deed? Ile be revengde. He offereth to throwe his dagger. KING. Away to prison with him, Ile clippe his winges\\n   Or ere he passe my handes, away with him. Exit Boy. But what availeth that this traitors dead,\\n   When Duke Dumaine his brother is alive,\\n   And that young Cardinall that is growne so proud? Goe to the Governour of Orleance,\\n   And will him in my name to kill the Duke. [Exit Captaine of the Guarde.] Get you away and strangle the Cardinall. [Exit murtherers.] These two will make one entire Duke of Guise,\\n   Especially with our olde mothers helpe. EPERNOUNE. My Lord, see where she comes, as if she droupt\\n   To heare these newest\\n\\n        Enter Queene Mother [attended]. KING. And let her croup, my heart is light enough. Mother, how like you this device of mine? I slew the Guise, because I would be King. QUEENE MOTHER. King, why so thou wert before. Pray God thou be a King now this is done. KING. Nay he was King and countermanded me,\\n   But now I will be King and rule my selfe,\\n   And make the Guisians stoup that are alive. QUEENE MOTHER. I cannot speak for greefe: when thou went home,\\n   I would that I had murdered thee my sonne. My sonne: thou art a changeling, not my sonne. I curse thee and exclaime thee miscreant,\\n   Traitor to God, and to the realme of France. KING. Cry out, exclaime, houle till thy throat be hoarce,\\n   The Guise is slaine, and I rejoyce therefore:\\n   And now will I to armes, come Epernoune:\\n   And let her greeve her heart out if she will. Exit the King and Epernoune. QUEENE MOTHER. Away, leave me alone to meditate. Sweet Guise, would he had died so thou wert heere:\\n   To whom shall I bewray my secrets now,\\n   Or who will helpe to builde Religion? The Protestants will glory and insulte,\\n   Wicked Navarre will get the crowne of France,\\n   The Popedome cannot stand, all goes to wrack,\\n   And all for thee my Guise: what may I doe? But sorrow seaze upon my toyling soule,\\n   For since the Guise is dead, I will not live. Exit [the attendants taking up body of the Guise].

What, will you fyle your handes with Churchmens bloud? 2. Shed your bloud,\\n   O Lord no: for we entend to strangle you. CARDINALL. Then there is no remedye but I must dye? 1. No remedye, therefore prepare your selfe. CARDINALL. Yet lives\\n   My brother Duke Dumaine, and many moe:\\n   To revenge our deaths upon that cursed King,\\n   Upon whose heart may all the furies gripe,\\n   And with their pawes drench his black soule in hell. 1. Yours my Lord Cardinall, you should have saide. Now they strangle him. So, pluck amaine,\\n   He is hard hearted, therfore pull with violence. Come take him away. Exeunt. [Scene xxi]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Duke Dumayn reading of a letter, with others. DUMAINE. My noble brother murthered by the King,\\n   Oh what may I doe, to revenge thy death? The Kings alone, it cannot satisfie. Sweet Duke of Guise our prop to leane upon,\\n   Now thou art dead, heere is no stay for us:\\n   I am thy brother, and ile revenge thy death,\\n   And roote Valois's line from forth of France,\\n   And beate proud Burbon to his native home,\\n   That basely seekes to joyne with such a King,\\n   Whose murderous thoughts will be his overthrow. Hee wild the Governour of Orleance in his name,\\n   That I with speed should have beene put to death. But thats prevented, for to end his life,\\n   And all those traitors to the Church of Rome,\\n   That durst attempt to murder noble Guise. Enter the Frier. FRIER. My Lord, I come to bring you newes, that your brother\\n   the Cardinall of Loraine by the Kings consent is lately strangled\\n   unto death. DUMAINE. My brother Cardenall slaine and I alive? O wordes of power to kill a thousand men. Come let us away and leavy men,\\n   Tis warre that must asswage the tyrantes pride. FRIER. My Lord, heare me but speak. I am a Frier of the order of the Jacobyns, that for my\\n   conscience sake will kill the King. DUMAINE. But what doth move thee above the rest to doe the deed? FRIER. O my Lord, I have beene a great sinner in my dayes, and\\n   the deed is meritorious. DUMAINE. But how wilt thou get opportunitye? FRIER. Tush my Lord, let me alone for that. DUMAINE. Frier come with me,\\n   We will goe talke more of this within. Exeunt.

       "\"\\n\\n        Enter Charles the French King, [Catherine] the Queene Mother,\\n        the King of Navarre, the Prince of Condye, the Lord high\\n        Admirall, and [Margaret] the Queene of Navarre, with others. CHARLES. Prince of Navarre my honourable brother,\\n   Prince Condy, and my good Lord Admirall,\\n   wishe this union and religious league,\\n   Knit in these hands, thus joyn'd in nuptiall rites,\\n   May not desolve, till death desolve our lives,\\n   And that the native sparkes of princely love,\\n   That kindled first this motion in our hearts,\\n   May still be feweld in our progenye. NAVAREE. The many favours which your grace has showne,\\n   From time to time, but specially in this,\\n   Shall binde me ever to your highnes will,\\n   In what Queen Mother or your grace commands. QUEENE MOTHER. Thanks sonne Navarre, you see we love you well,\\n   That linke you in mariage with our daughter heer:\\n   And as you know, our difference in Religion\\n   Might be a meanes to crosse you in your love. CHARLES. Well Madam, let that rest:\\n   And now my Lords the mariage rites perfourm'd,\\n   We think it good to goe and consumate\\n   The rest, with hearing of an holy Masse:\\n   Sister, I think your selfe will beare us company. QUEENE MARGARET. I will my good Lord. CHARLES. The rest that will not goe (my Lords) may stay:\\n   Come Mother,\\n   Let us goe to honor this solemnitie. QUEENE MOTHER. Which Ile desolve with bloud and crueltie. [Aside.] Exit [Charles] the King, Queene Mother, and [Margaret]\\n        the Queene of Navar [with others], and manet Navar,\\n        the Prince of Condy, and the Lord high Admirall. NAVARRE. Prince Condy and my good Lord Admiral,\\n   Now Guise may storme but does us little hurt:\\n   Having the King, Queene Mother on our side,\\n   To stop the mallice of his envious heart,\\n   That seekes to murder all the Protestants:\\n   Have you not heard of late how he decreed,\\n   If that the King had given consent thereto,\\n   That all the protestants that are in Paris,\\n   Should have been murdered the other night? ADMIRALL. My Lord I mervaile that th'aspiring Guise\\n   Dares once adventure without the Kings assent,\\n   To meddle or attempt such dangerous things. CONDY. My Lord you need not mervaile at the Guise,\\n   For what he doth the Pope will ratifie:\\n   In murder, mischeefe, or in tiranny. NAVARRE. But he that sits and rules above the clowdes,\\n   Doth heare and see the praiers of the just:\\n   And will revenge the bloud of innocents,\\n   That Guise hath slaine by treason of his heart,\\n   And brought by murder to their timeles ends. ADMIRALL. My Lord, but did you mark the Cardinall\\n   The Guises brother, and the Duke Dumain:\\n   How they did storme at these your nuptiall rites,\\n   Because the house of Burbon now comes in,\\n   And joynes your lineage to the crowne of France? NAVARRE. And thats the cause that Guise so frowns at us,\\n   And beates his braines to catch us in his trap,\\n   Which he hath pitcht within his deadly toyle. Come my Lords lets go to the Church and pray,\\n   That God may still defend the right of France:\\n   And make his Gospel flourish in this land. Exeunt. [Scene ii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the Duke of Guise. GUISE. If ever Hymen lowr'd at marriage rites,\\n   And had his alters decks with duskie lightes:\\n   If ever sunne stainde heaven with bloudy clowdes,\\n   And made it look with terrour on the worlde:\\n   If ever day were turnde to ugly night,\\n   And night made semblance of the hue of hell,\\n   This day, this houre, this fatall night,\\n   Shall fully shew the fury of them all. Apothecarie.--\\n\\n        Enter the Pothecarie. POTHECARIE. My Lord. GUISE. Now shall I prove and guerdon to the ful,\\n   The love thou bear'st unto the house of Guise:\\n   Where are those perfumed gloves which late I sent\\n   To be poysoned, hast thou done them? speake,\\n   Will every savour breed a pangue of death? POTHECARIE. See where they be my Lord, and he that smelles\\n   but to them, dyes. GUISE. Then thou remainest resolute. POTHECARIE. I am my Lord, in what your grace commaundes till death. GUISE. Thankes my good freend, I wil requite thy love. Goe then, present them to the Queene Navarre:\\n   For she is that huge blemish in our eye,\\n   That makes these upstart heresies in Fraunce:\\n   Be gone my freend, present them to her straite. Souldyer.--\\n\\n        Exit Pothecaier. Enter a Souldier. SOULDIER. My Lord. GUISE. Now come thou forth and play thy tragick part,\\n   Stand in some window opening neere the street,\\n   And when thou seest the Admirall ride by,\\n   Discharge thy musket and perfourme his death:\\n   And then Ile guerdon thee with store of crownes. SOULDIER. I will my Lord. Exit Souldier. GUISE. Now Guise, begin those deepe ingendred thoughts\\n   To burst abroad, those never dying flames,\\n   Which cannot be extinguisht but by bloud. Oft have I leveld, and at last have learnd,\\n   That perill is the cheefest way to happines,\\n   And resolution honors fairest aime. What glory is there in a common good,\\n   That hanges for every peasant to atchive? That like I best that flyes beyond my reach. Set me to scale the high Peramides,\\n   And thereon set the Diadem of Fraunce,\\n   Ile either rend it with my nayles to naught,\\n   Or mount the top with my aspiring winges,\\n   Although my downfall be the deepest hell. For this, I wake, when others think I sleepe,\\n   For this, I waite, that scorn attendance else:\\n   For this, my quenchles thirst whereon I builde,\\n   Hath often pleaded kindred to the King. For this, this head, this heart, this hand and sworde,\\n   Contrive, imagine and fully execute\\n   Matters of importe, aimed at by many,\\n   Yet understoode by none. For this, hath heaven engendred me of earth,\\n   For this, the earth sustaines my bodies weight,\\n   And with this wait Ile counterpoise a Crowne,\\n   Or with seditions weary all the worlde:\\n   For this, from Spaine the stately Catholic\\n   Sends Indian golde to coyne me French ecues:\\n   For this have I a largesse from the Pope,\\n   A pension and a dispensation too:\\n   And by that priviledge to worke upon,\\n   My policye hath framde religion. Religion: O Diabole. Fye, I am ashamde, how ever that I seeme,\\n   To think a word of such a simple sound,\\n   Of so great matter should be made the ground. The gentle King whose pleasure uncontrolde,\\n   Weakneth his body, and will waste his Realme,\\n   If I repaire not what he ruinates:\\n   Him as a childe I dayly winne with words,\\n   So that for proofe, he barely beares the name:\\n   I execute, and he sustaines the blame. The Mother Queene workes wonders for my sake,\\n   And in my love entombes the hope of Fraunce:\\n   Rifling the bowels of her treasurie,\\n   To supply my wants and necessitie. Paris hath full five hundred Colledges,\\n   As Monestaries, Priories, Abbyes and halles,\\n   Wherein are thirtie thousand able men,\\n   Besides a thousand sturdy student Catholicks,\\n   And more: of my knowledge in one cloyster keep,\\n   Five hundred fatte Franciscan Fryers and priestes. All this and more, if more may be comprisde,\\n   To bring the will of our desires to end. Then Guise,\\n   Since thou hast all the Cardes within thy hands\\n   To shuffle or to cut, take this as surest thing:\\n   That right or wrong, thou deal'st thy selfe a King. I but, Navarre. Tis but a nook of France. Sufficient yet for such a pettie King:\\n   That with a rablement of his hereticks,\\n   Blindes Europs eyes and troubleth our estate:\\n   Him will we--\\n\\n        Pointing to his Sworde. But first lets follow those in France. That hinder our possession to the crowne:\\n   As Caesar to his souldiers, so say I:\\n   Those that hate me, will I learn to loath. Give me a look, that when I bend the browes,\\n   Pale death may walke in furrowes of my face:\\n   A hand, that with a graspe may gripe the world,\\n   An eare, to heare what my detractors say,\\n   A royall seate, a scepter and a crowne:\\n   That those which doe behold them may become\\n   As men that stand and gase against the Sunne. The plot is laide, and things shall come to passe,\\n   Where resolution strives for victory. Exit. [Scene iii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the King of Navar and Queen [Margaret], and his [olde]\\n        Mother Queen [of Navarre], the Prince of Condy, the Admirall,\\n        and the Pothecary with the gloves, and gives them to the olde\\n        Queene. POTHECARIE. Maddame, I beseech your grace to except this simple gift. OLD QUEENE. Thanks my good freend, holde, take thou this reward. POTHECARIE. I humbly thank your Majestie. Exit Pothecary. OLD QUEENE. Me thinkes the gloves have a very strong perfume,\\n   The sent whereof doth make my head to ake. NAVARRE. Doth not your grace know the man that gave them you? OLD QUEENE. Not wel, but do remember such a man. ADMIRALL. Your grace was ill advisde to take them then,\\n   Considering of these dangerous times. OLD QUEENE. Help sonne Navarre, I am poysoned. QUEENE MARGARET. The heavens forbid your highnes such mishap. NAVARRE. The late suspition of the Duke of Guise,\\n   Might well have moved your highnes to beware\\n   How you did meddle with such dangerous giftes. QUEENE MARGARET. Too late it is my Lord if that be true\\n   To blame her highnes, but I hope it be\\n   Only some naturall passion makes her sicke. OLD QUEENE. O no, sweet Margaret, the fatall poyson\\n   Doth work within my heart, my brain pan breakes,\\n   My heart doth faint, I dye. She dyes. NAVARRE. My Mother poysoned heere before my face:\\n   O gracious God, what times are these? O graunt sweet God my daies may end with hers,\\n   That I with her may dye and live againe. QUEENE MARGARET. Let not this heavy chaunce my dearest Lord,\\n   (For whose effects my soule is massacred)\\n   Infect thy gracious brest with fresh supply,\\n   To agravate our sodaine miserie. ADMIRALL. Come my Lords let us beare her body hence,\\n   And see it honoured with just solemnitie. As they are going, [enter] the Souldier [above, who] dischargeth\\n        his musket at the Lord Admirall [and exit]. CONDY. What are you hurt my Lord high Admiral? ADMIRALL. I my good Lord, shot through the arme. NAVARRE. We are betraide, come my Lords, and let us goe tell\\n   the King of this. ADMIRALL. These are the cursed Guisians that doe seeke our death. Oh fatall was this mariage to us all. They beare away the [olde] Queene [of Navarre] and goe out. [Scene iv]\\n\\n\\n        Enter [Charles] the King, [Catherine] the Queene Mother, Duke of Guise,\\n        Duke Anjou, Duke Demayne [and Cossin, Captain of the Kings Guard]. QUEENE MOTHER. My noble sonne, and princely Duke of Guise,\\n   Now have we got the fatall stragling deere,\\n   Within the compasse of a deadly toyle,\\n   And as we late decreed we may perfourme. CHARLES. Madam, it wilbe noted through the world,\\n   An action bloudy and tirannicall:\\n   Cheefely since under safetie of our word,\\n   They justly challenge their protection:\\n   Besides my heart relentes that noble men,\\n   Onely corrupted in religion,\\n   Ladies of honor, Knightes and Gentlemen,\\n   Should for their conscience taste such rutheles ends. ANJOY. Though gentle minces should pittie others paines,\\n   Yet will the wisest note their proper greefes:\\n   And rather seeke to scourge their enemies,\\n   Then be themselves base subjects to the whip. GUISE. Me thinkes my Lord, Anjoy hath well advisde\\n   Your highnes to consider of the thing,\\n   And rather chuse to seek your countries good,\\n   Then pittie or releeve these upstart hereticks. QUEENE MOTHER. I hope these reasons mayserve my princely, Sonne,\\n   To have some care for feare of enemies. CHARLES. Well Madam, I referre it to your Majestie,\\n   And to my Nephew heere the Duke of Guise:\\n   What you determine, I will ratifie. QUEENE MOTHER. Thankes to my princely sonne, then tell me Guise,\\n   What order wil you set downe for the Massacre? GUISE. Thus Madame. They that shalbe actors in this Massacre,\\n   Shall weare white crosses on their Burgonets,\\n   And tye white linnen scarfes about their armes. He that wantes these, and is suspect of heresie,\\n   Shall dye, or be he King or Emperour. Then Ile have a peale of ordinance shot from the tower,\\n   At which they all shall issue out and set the streetes. And then the watchword being given, a bell shall ring,\\n   Which when they heare, they shall begin to kill:\\n   And never cease untill that bell shall cease,\\n   Then breath a while. Enter the Admirals man. CHARLES. How now fellow, what newes? MAN. And it please your grace the Lord high Admirall,\\n   Riding the streetes was traiterously shot,\\n   And most humbly intreates your Majestie\\n   To visite him sick in his bed. CHARLES. Messenger, tell him I will see him straite. Exit Messenger. What shall we doe now with the Admirall? QUEENE MOTHER. Your Majesty had best goe visite him,\\n   And make a shew as if all were well. CHARLES. Content, I will goe visite the Admirall. GUISE. And I will goe take order for his death. Exit Guise. Enter the Admirall in his bed. CHARLES. How fares it with my Lord high Admiral,\\n   Hath he been hurt with villaines in the street? I vow and sweare as I am King of France,\\n   To finde and to repay the man with death:\\n   With death delay'd and torments never usde,\\n   That durst presume for hope of any gaine,\\n   To hurt the noble man his sovereign loves. ADMIRALL. Ah my good Lord, these are the Guisians,\\n   That seeke to massacre our guiltles lives. CHARLES. Assure your selfe my good Lord Admirall,\\n   I deepely sorrow for your trecherous wrong:\\n   And that I am not more secure my selfe,\\n   Then I am carefull you should be preserved. Cossin, take twenty of our strongest guarde,\\n   And under your direction see they keep\\n   All trecherous violence from our noble freend,\\n   Repaying all attempts with present death,\\n   Upon the cursed breakers of our peace. And so be pacient good Lord Admirall,\\n   And every hower I will visite you. Exeunt omnes. [Scene v]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Guise, Anjoy, Dumaine, Gonzago, Retes, Montsorrell, and\\n        Souldiers to the massacre. GUISE. Anjoy, Dumaine, Gonzago, Retes, sweare by\\n   The argent crosses on your burgonets,\\n   To kill all that you suspect of heresie. DUMAINE. I sweare by this to be unmercifull. ANJOY. I am disguisde and none nows who I am,\\n   And therfore meane to murder all I meet. GONZAGO. And so will I.\\n\\n   RETES. And I.\\n\\n   GUISE. Away then, break into the Admirals house. GETES. I let the Admirall be first dispatcht. GUISE. The Admirall,\\n   Cheefe standard bearer to the Lutheranes,\\n   Shall in the entrance of this Massacre,\\n   Be murdered in his bed. Gonzago conduct them hither, and then\\n   Beset his house that not a man may live. ANJOY. That charge is mine. Swizers keepe you the streetes,\\n   And at ech corner shall the Kings garde stand. GONZAGO. Come sirs follow me. Exit Gonzago and others with him. ANJOY. Cossin, the Captaine of the Admirals guarde,\\n   Plac'd by my brother, will betray his Lord:\\n   Now Guise shall catholiques flourish once againe,\\n   The head being of, the members cannot stand. RETES. But look my Lord, ther's some in the Admirals house. Enter [above Gonzago and others] into the Admirals house,\\n        and he in his bed. ANJOY. In lucky time, come let us keep this lane,\\n   And slay his servants that shall issue out. GONZAGO. Where is the Admirall? ADMIRALL. O let me pray before I dye. GONZAGO. Then pray unto our Ladye, kisse this crosse. Stab him. ADMIRALL. O God forgive my sins. GUISE. What, is he dead Gonzago? GONZAGO. I my Lord. GUISE. Then throw him down. [The body is thrown down. Exeunt Gonzago and rest above.] ANJOY. Now cosin view him well,\\n   It may be it is some other, and he escapte. GUISE. Cosin tis he, I know him by his look. See where my Souldier shot him through the arm. He mist him neer, but we have strook him now. Ah base Shatillian and degenerate,\\n   Cheef standard bearer to the Lutheranes,\\n   Thus in despite of thy Religion,\\n   The Duke of Guise stampes on thy liveles bulke. Away with him, cut of his head and handes,\\n   And send them for a present to the Pope:\\n   And when this just revenge is finished,\\n   Unto mount Faucon will we dragge his coarse:\\n   And he that living hated so the crosse,\\n   Shall being dead, be hangd thereon in chaines. GUISE. Anjoy, Gonzago, Retes, if that you three,\\n   Will be as resolute as I and Dumaine:\\n   There shall not a Hugonet breath in France. ANJOY. I sweare by this crosse, wee'l not be partiall,\\n   But slay as many as we can come neer. GUISE. Mountsorrett, go and shoote the ordinance of,\\n   That they which have already set the street\\n   May know their watchword, and then tole the bell,\\n   And so lets forward to the Massacre. MOUNTSORRELL. I will my Lord. Exit Mountsorrell. GUISE. And now my Lords let us closely to our busines. ANJOY. Anjoy will follow thee. DUMAINE. And so will Dumaine. The ordinance being shot of, the bell tolles. GUISE. Come then, lets away. Exeunt. The Guise enters againe, with all the rest, with their Swords drawne,\\n        chasing the Protestants. GUISE. Tue, tue, tue,\\n   Let none escape, murder the Hugonets. ANJOY. Kill them, kill them. Exeunt. Enter Loreine running, the Guise and the rest pursuing him. GUISE. Loreine, Loreine, follow Loreine.. Sirra,\\n   Are you a preacher of these heresies? LOREINE. I am a preacher of the word of God,\\n   And thou a traitor to thy soule and him. GUISE. Dearely beloved brother, thus tis written. He stabs him. ANJOY. Stay my Lord, let me begin the psalme. GUISE. Come dragge him away and throw him in a ditch. Exeunt [omnes]. [Scene vi]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Mountsorrell and knocks at Serouns doore. SEROUNS WIFE. Who is't that knocks there? [Within.] MOUNTSORRELL. Mountsorrett from the Duke of Guise. SEROUNS WIFE. Husband come down, heer's one would speak with\\n   you from the Duke of Guise. Enter Seroune. SEROUNE. To speek with me from such a man as he? MOUNTSORRELL. I, I, for this Seroune, and thou shalt ha't. Shewing his dagger. SEROUNE. O let me pray before I take my death. MOUNTSORRELL. Despatch then quickly. SEROUNE. O Christ my Saviour--\\n\\n   MOUNTSORRELL. Christ, villaine? Why, darst thou presume to call on Christ,\\n   Without the intercession of some Saint? Sanctus Jacobus hee was my Saint, pray to him. SEROUNE. O let me pray unto my God. MOUNTSORRELL. Then take this with you. Stab him [and he falls within and dies]. Exit. [Scene vii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Ramus in his studie. RAMUS. What fearfull cries come from the river Sene,\\n   That fright poore Ramus sitting at his book? I feare the Guisians have past the bridge,\\n   And meane once more to menace me. Enter Taleus. TALEUS. Flye Ramus flye, if thou wilt save thy life. RAMUS. Tell me Taleus, wherfore should I flye? TALEUS. The Guisians are hard at thy doore,\\n   And meane to murder us:\\n   Harke, harke they come, Ile leap out at the window. [Runs out from studie.] RAMUS. Sweet Taleus stay. Enter Gonzago and Retes. GONZAGO. Who goes there? RETES. Tis Taleus, Ramus bedfellow. GONZAGO. What art thou? TALEUS. I am as Ramus is, a Christian. RETES. O let him goe, he is a catholick. Exit Taleus. Enter Ramus [out of his studie]. GONZAGO. Come Ramus, more golde, or thou shalt have the stabbe. RAMUS. Alas I am a scholler, how should I have golde? All that I have is but my stipend from the King,\\n   Which is no sooner receiv'd but it is spent. Enter the Guise and Anjoy [, Dumaine, Mountsorrell,\\n        with soldiers]. ANJOY. Whom have you there? RETES. Tis Ramus, the Kings professor of Logick. GUISE. Stab him. RAMUS. O good my Lord,\\n   Wherein hath Ramus been so offencious? GUISE. Marry sir, in having a smack in all,\\n   And yet didst never sound any thing to the depth. Was it not thou that scoff'dst the Organon,\\n   And said it was a heape of vanities? He that will be a flat decotamest,\\n   And seen in nothing but Epitomies:\\n   Is in your judgment thought a learned man. And he forsooth must goe and preach in Germany:\\n   Excepting against Doctors actions,\\n   And ipse dixi with this quidditie,\\n   Argumentum testimonis est in arte partialis. To contradict which, I say Ramus shall dye:\\n   How answere you that? your nego argumentum\\n   Cannot serve, Sirrah, kill him. RAMUS. O good my Lord, let me but speak a word. ANJOY. Well, say on. RAMUS. Not for my life doe I desire this pause,\\n   But in my latter houre to purge my selfe,\\n   In that I know the things that I have wrote,\\n   Which as I heare one Shekins takes it ill,\\n   Because my places being but three, contain all his:\\n   I knew the Organon to be confusde,\\n   And I reduc'd it into better forme. And this for Aristotle will I say,\\n   That he that despiseth him, can nere\\n   Be good in Logick or Philosophie. And thats because the blockish Sorbonests\\n   Attribute as much unto their workes,\\n   As to the service of the eternall God. GUISE. Why suffer you that peasant to declaime? Stab him I say and send him to his freends in hell. ANJOY. Nere was there Colliars sonne so full of pride. Kill him. [Close the studie.] GUISE. My Lord Anjoy, there are a hundred Protestants,\\n   Which we have chaste into the river Sene,\\n   That swim about and so preserve their lives:\\n   How may we doe? I feare me they will live. DUMAINE. Goe place some men upon the bridge,\\n   With bowes and cartes to shoot at them they see,\\n   And sinke them in the river as they swim. GUISE. Tis well advisde Dumain, goe see it done. Exit Dumaine. And in the mean time my Lord, could we devise,\\n   To get those pedantes from the King Navarre,\\n   That are tutors to him and the prince of Condy--\\n\\n   ANJOY. For that let me alone, Cousin stay heer,\\n   And when you see me in, then follow hard. He knocketh, and enter the King of Navarre and Prince\\n        of Condy, with their scholmaisters. How now my Lords, how fare you? NAVARRE. My Lord, they say\\n   That all the protestants are massacred. ANJOY. I, so they are, but yet what remedy:\\n   I have done all I could to stay this broile. NAVARRE. But yet my Lord the report doth run,\\n   That you were one that made this Massacre. ANJOY. Who I? you are deceived, I rose but now\\n\\n        Enter [to them] Guise. GUISE. Murder the Hugonets, take those pedantes hence. NAVARRE. Thou traitor Guise, lay of thy bloudy hands. CONDY. Come let us goe tell the King. Exeunt [Condy and Navarre]. GUISE. Come sirs, Ile whip you to death with my punniards point. He kils them. ANJOY. Away with them both. Exit Anjoy [and soldiers with bodies]. GUISE. And now sirs for this night let our fury stay. Yet will we not the Massacre shall end:\\n   Gonzago posse you to Orleance, Retes to Deep,\\n   Mountsorrell unto Roan, and spare not one\\n   That you suspect of heresy. And now stay\\n   That bel that to the devils mattins rings. Now every man put of his burgonet,\\n   And so convey him closely to his bed. Exeunt. [Scene viii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter Anjoy, with two Lords of Poland. ANJOY. My Lords of Poland I must needs confesse,\\n   The offer of your Prince Elector's, farre\\n   Beyond the reach of my desertes:\\n   For Poland is as I have been enformde,\\n   A martiall people, worthy such a King,\\n   As hath sufficient counsaile in himselfe,\\n   To lighten doubts and frustrate subtile foes. And such a King whom practice long hath taught,\\n   To please himselfe with mannage of the warres,\\n   The greatest warres within our Christian bounds,\\n   I meane our warres against the Muscovites:\\n   And on the other side against the Turke,\\n   Rich Princes both, and mighty Emperours:\\n   Yet by my brother Charles our King of France,\\n   And by his graces councell it is thought,\\n   That if I undertake to weare the crowne\\n   Of Poland, it may prejudice their hope\\n   Of my inheritance to the crowne of France:\\n   For if th'almighty take my brother hence,\\n   By due discent the Regall seat is mine. With Poland therfore must I covenant thus,\\n   That if by death of Charles, the diadem\\n   Of France be cast on me, then with your leaves\\n   I may retire me to my native home. If your commission serve to warrant this,\\n   I thankfully shall undertake the charge\\n   Of you and yours, and carefully maintaine\\n   The wealth and safety of your kingdomes right. LORD. All this and more your highnes shall commaund,\\n   For Polands crowne and kingly diadem. ANJOY. Then come my Lords, lets goe. Exeunt. [Scene ix]\\n\\n\\n\\n        Enter two with the Admirals body. 1. Now sirra, what shall we doe with the Admirall? 2. Why let us burne him for a heretick. 1. O no, his bodye will infect the fire, and the fire the aire, and\\n   so we shall be poysoned with him. 2. What shall we doe then? 1. Lets throw him into the river. 2. Oh twill corrupt the water, and the water the fish, and the\\n   fish our selves when we eate them. 1. Then throw him into the ditch. 2. No, no, to decide all doubts, be rulde by me, lets hang him\\n   upon this tree. 1. Agreede. They hang him. Enter the Duke of Guise, and Queene Mother, and the\\n        Cardinall [of Loraine]. GUISE. Now Madame, how like you our lusty Admirall? QUEENE MOTHER. Beleeve me Guise he becomes the place so well,\\n   That I could long ere this have wisht him there. But come lets walke aside, th'airs not very sweet. GUISE. No by my faith Madam. Sirs, take him away and throw him in some ditch. Carry away the dead body. And now Madam as I understand,\\n   There anre a hundred Hugonets and more,\\n   Which in the woods doe horde their synagogue:\\n   And dayly meet about this time of day,\\n   thither will I to put them to the sword. QUEENE MOTHER. Doe so sweet Guise, let us delay no time,\\n   For if these straglers gather head againe,\\n   And disperse themselves throughout the Realme of France,\\n   It will be hard for us to worke their deaths. GUISE. Madam,\\n   I goe as whirl-winces rage before a storme. Exit Guise. QUEENE MOTHER. My Lord of Loraine have you marks of late,\\n   How Charles our sonne begins for to lament\\n   For the late nights worke which my Lord of Guise\\n   Did make in Paris amongst the Hugonites? CARDINALL. Madam, I have heard him solemnly vow,\\n   With the rebellious King of Navarre,\\n   For to revenge their deaths upon us all. QUEENE MOTHER. I, but my Lord, let me alone for that,\\n   For Katherine must have her will in France:\\n   As I doe live, so surely shall he dye,\\n   And Henry then shall weare the diadem. And if he grudge or crosse his Mothers will,\\n   Ile disinherite him and all the rest:\\n   For Ile rule France, but they shall weare the crowne:\\n   And if they storme, I then may pull them downe.

I tell thee Mugeroun we will be freends,\\n   And fellowes to, what ever stormes arise. MUGEROUN.

My Lord Cardinall of Loraine, tell me,\\n   How likes your grace my sonnes pleasantnes? His mince you see runnes on his minions,\\n   And all his heaven is to delight himselfe:\\n   And whilste he sleepes securely thus in ease,\\n   Thy brother Guise and we may now provide,\\n   To plant our selves with such authoritie,\\n   That not a man may live without our leaves.

And then shall Mounser weare the diadem. Tush, all shall dye unles I have my will:\\n   For while she lives Katherine will be Queene. Come my Lord, let us goe to seek the Guise,\\n   And then determine of this enterprise. Exeunt. [Scene xiii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the Duchesse of Guise, and her Maide. DUCHESSE.

Enter the Maid with Inke and Paper. So, set it down and leave me to my selfe. O would to God this quill that heere doth write,\\n\\n        She writes. Had late been plucks from out faire Cupids wing:\\n   That it might print these lines within his heart. Enter the Guise. GUISE. What, all alone my love, and writing too:\\n   I prethee say to whome thou writes? DUCHESSE. To such a one, as when she reads my lines,\\n   Will laugh I feare me at their good aray. GUISE. I pray thee let me see. DUCHESSE. O no my Lord, a woman only must\\n   Partake the secrets of my heart. GUISE. But Madam I must see. He takes it. Are these your secrets that no man must know? DUCHESSE. O pardon me my Lord. GUISE. Thou trothles and unjust, what lines are these? Am I growne olde, or is thy lust growne yong,\\n   Or hath my love been so obscurde in thee,\\n   That others need to comment on my text? Is all my love forgot which helde thee deare? I, dearer then the apple of mine eye? Is Guises glory but a clowdy mist,\\n   In sight and judgement of thy lustfull eye? Mor du, were not the fruit within thy wombe,\\n   On whose encrease I set some longing hope:\\n   This wrathfull hand should strike thee to the hart\\n   Hence strumpet, hide thy head for shame,\\n   And fly my presence if thou look'st to live. Exit [Duchesse]. O wicked sexe, perjured and unjust,\\n   Now doe I see that from the very first,\\n   Her eyes and lookes sow'd seeds of perjury,\\n   But villaine he to whom these lines should goe,\\n   Shall buy her love even with his dearest bloud. Exit. [Scene xiv]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the King of Navarre, Pleshe and Bartus, and their train,\\n        with drums and trumpets. NAVARRE. Now Lords, since in a quarrell just and right,\\n   We undertake to mannage these our warres\\n   Against the proud disturbers of the faith,\\n   I meane the Guise, the Pope, and King of Spaine,\\n   Who set themselves to tread us under foot,\\n   And rend our true religion from this land:\\n   But for you know our quarrell is no more,\\n   But to defend their strange inventions,\\n   Which they will put us to with sword and fire:\\n   We must with resolute minces resolve to fight,\\n   In honor of our God and countries good. Spaine is the counsell chamber of the pope,\\n   Spaine is the place where he makes peace and warre,\\n   And Guise for Spaine hath now incenst the King,\\n   To send his power to meet us in the field. BARTUS. Then in this bloudy brunt they may beholde,\\n   The sole endevour of your princely care,\\n   To plant the true succession of the faith,\\n   In spite of Spaine and all his heresies. NAVARRE. The power of vengeance now implants it selfe,\\n   Upon the hauty mountains of my brest:\\n   Plaies with her goary coulours of revenge,\\n   Whom I respect as leaves of boasting greene,\\n   That change their coulour when the winter comes,\\n   When I shall vaunt as victor in revenge. Enter a Messenger. How now sirra, what newes? MESSENGER. My Lord, as by our scoutes we understande,\\n   A mighty army comes from France with speed:\\n   Which is already mustered in the land,\\n   And meanesto meet your highnes in the field. NAVARRE. In Gods name, let them come. This is the Guise that hath incenst the King,\\n   To leavy armes and make these civill broyles:\\n   But canst thou tell me who is their generall? MESSENGER. Not yet my Lord, for thereon doe they stay:\\n   But as report doth goe, the Duke of Joyeux\\n   Hath made great sute unto the King therfore. NAVARRE. It will not countervaile his paines I hope,\\n   I would the Guise in his steed might have come,\\n   But he doth lurke within his drousie couch,\\n   And makes his footstoole on securitie:\\n   So he be safe he cares not what becomes,\\n   Of King or Country, no not for them both. But come my Lords, let us away with speed,\\n   And place our selves in order for the fight. Exeunt. [Scene xv]\\n\\n\\n        Enter [Henry] the King of France, Duke of Guise, Epernoune,\\n        and Duke Joyeux. KING. My sweet Joyeux, I make thee Generall,\\n   Of all my army now in readines,\\n   To march against the rebellious King Navarre:\\n   At thy request I am content thou go'st,\\n   Although my love to thee can hardly suffer't,\\n   Regarding still the danger of thy life. JOYEUX. Thanks to your Majestie, and so I take my leave. Farwell my Lord of Guise and Epernoune. GUISE. Health and harty farwell to my Lord Joyeux. Exit Joyeux. KING. How kindely Cosin of Guise you and your wife\\n   Doe both salute our lovely Minions. He makes hornes at the Guise. Remember you the letter gentle sir,\\n   Which your wife writ to my deare Minion,\\n   And her chosen freend? GUISE. How now my Lord, faith this is more then need,\\n   Am I to be thus jested at and scornde? Tis more then kingly or Emperious. And sure if all the proudest kings beside\\n   In Christendome, should beare me such derision,\\n   They should know I scornde them and their mockes. I love your Minions? dote on them your selfe,\\n   I know none els but hordes them in disgrace:\\n   And heer by all the Saints in heaven I sweare,\\n   That villain for whom I beare this deep disgrace,\\n   Even for your words that have incenst me so,\\n   Shall buy that strumpets favour with his blood,\\n   Whether he have dishonoured me or no. Par la mor du, Il mora. Exit. KING. Beleeve me, Epernoune this jest bites sore. EPERNOUNE. My Lord, twere good to make them frends,\\n   For his othes are seldome spent in vaine. Enter Mugeroun. KING. How now Mugeroun, metst thou not the Guise at the doore? MUGEROUN. Not I my Lord, what if I had? KING. Marry if thou hadst, thou mightst have had the stab,\\n   For he hath solemnely sworne thy death. MUGEROUN. I may be stabd, and live till he be dead,\\n   But wherfore beares he me such deadly hate? KING. Because his wife beares thee such kindely love. MUGEROUN. If that be all, the next time that I meet her,\\n   Ile make her shake off love with her heeles. But which way is he gone? Ile goe take a walk\\n   On purpose from the Court to meet with him. Exit. KING. I like not this, come Epernoune\\n   Lets goe seek the Duke and make them freends. Exeunt. [Scene xvi]\\n\\n\\n        Alarums within. The Duke Joyeux slaine. Enter the King of Navarre [, Bartus,] and his traine. NAVARRE. The Duke is slaine and all his power dispearst,\\n   And we are grac'd with wreathes of victory:\\n   Thus God we see doth ever guide the right,\\n   To make his glory great upon the earth. BARTUS. The terrour of this happy victory,\\n   I hope will make the King surcease his hate:\\n   And either never mannage army more,\\n   Or else employ them in some better cause. NAVARRE. How many noble men have lost their lives,\\n   In prosecution of these quell armes,\\n   Is ruth and almost death to call to mince:\\n   Put God we know will alwaies put them downe,\\n   That lift themselves against the perfect truth,\\n   Which Ile maintaine as long as life doth last:\\n   And with the Queene of England joyne my force,\\n   To beat the papall Monarck from our lands,\\n   And keep those relicks from our countries coastes. Come my Lords, now that the storme is overpass,\\n   Let us away with triumph to our tents. Exeunt. [Scene xvii]\\n\\n\\n      Enter a Souldier. SOULDIER. Sir, to you sir, that dare make the Duke a cuckolde,\\n   and use a counterfeite key to his privie Chamber doore: And\\n   although you take out nothing but your owne, yet you put in\\n   that which displeaseth him, and so forestall his market, and set up\\n   your standing where you should not: and whereas tree is your\\n   Landlord, you would take upon you to be his, and tyll the ground\\n   that he himself should occupy, which is his own free land. If it be\\n   not too free there's the question: and though I come not to take\\n   possession (as I would I might) yet I meane to keepe you out,\\n   which I will if this geare horde: what are ye come so soone? have at ye sir. Enter Mugeroun. He shootes at him and killes him. Enter the Guise [attended]. GUISE. Holde thee tall Souldier, take thou this and flye. Exit Souldier. Lye there the Kings delight, and Guises scorne. Revenge it Henry as thou list'st or dar'st,\\n   I did it only in despite of thee. Take him away. Enter the King and Epernoune. KING. My Lord of Guise, we understand that you\\n   Have gathered a power of men. What your intent is yet we cannot learn,\\n   But we presume it is not for our good. GUISE. Why I am no traitor to the crowne of France. What I have done tis for the Gospel's sake. EPERNOUNE. Nay for the Popes sake, and shine owne benefite. What Peere in France but thou (aspiring Guise)\\n   Durst be in armes without the Kings consent? I challenge thee for treason in the cause. GUISE. Oh base Epernoune, were not his highnes heere,\\n   Thou shouldst perceive the Duke of Guise is mov'd. KING. Be patient Guise and threat not Epernoune,\\n   Least thou perceive the King of France be mov'd. GUISE. Why? I am a Prince of the Valoyses line,\\n   Therfore an enemy to the Burbonites. I am a juror in the holy league,\\n   And therfore hated of the Protestants. What should I doe but stand upon my guarde? And being able, Ile keep an hoast in pay. EPERNOUNE. Thou able to maintaine an hoast in pay,\\n   That livest by forraine exhibition? The Pope and King of Spaine are thy good frends,\\n   Else all France knowes how poor a Duke thou art. KING. I, those are they that feed him with their golde,\\n   To countermaund our will and check our freends. GUISE. My Lord, to speak more plainely, thus it is:\\n   Being animated by Religious zeale,\\n   I meane to muster all the power I can,\\n   To overthrow those factious Puritans:\\n   And know, the Pope will sell his triple crowne,\\n   I, and the catholick Philip King of Spaine,\\n   Ere I shall want, will cause his Indians,\\n   To rip the golden bowels of America. Navarre that cloakes them underneath his wings,\\n   Shall feele the house of Lorayne is his foe:\\n   Your highnes need not feare mine armies force,\\n   Tis for your safetie and your enemies wrack. KING. Guise, weare our crowne, and be thou King of France,\\n   And as Dictator make or warre or peace,\\n   Whilste I cry placet like a Senator. I cannot brook thy hauty insolence,\\n   Dismisse thy campe or else by our Edict,\\n   Be thou proclaimde a traitor throughout France. GUISE. The choyse is hard, I must dissemble. [Aside.] My Lord, in token of my true humilitie,\\n   And simple meaning to your Majestie,\\n   I kisse your graces hand, and take my leave,\\n   Intending to dislodge my campe with speed. KING. Then farwell Guise, the King and thou art freends. Exit Guise. EPERNOUNE. But trust him not my Lord,\\n   For had your highnesse seene with what a pompe\\n   He entred Paris, and how the Citizens\\n   With gifts and shewes did entertaine him\\n   And promised to be at his commaund:\\n   Nay, they fear'd not to speak in the streetes,\\n   That Guise ch, durst stand in armes against the King,\\n   For not effecting of his holines will. KING. Did they of Paris entertaine him so? Then meanes he present treason to our state. Well, let me alone, whose within there? Enter one with e pen and inke. Make a discharge of all my counsell straite,\\n   And Ile subscribe my name and seale it straight. My head shall be my counsell, they are false:\\n   And Epernoune I will be rulde by thee. EPERNOUNE. My Lord,\\n   I think for safety of your person,\\n   It would be good the Guise were made away,\\n   And so to quite your grace of all suspect. KING. First let us set our hand and seale to this,\\n   And then Ile tell thee what I meane to doe. He writes. So, convey this to the counsell presently. Exit one. And Epernoune though I seeme milde and calme,\\n   Thinke not but I am tragicall within:\\n   Ile secretly convey me unto Bloyse,\\n   For now that Paris takes the Guises parse,\\n   Heere is not staying for the King of France,\\n   Unles he means to be betraide and dye:\\n   But as I live, so sure the Guise shall dye. Exeunt. [Scene xviii]\\n\\n\\n        Enter the King of Navarre reading of a letter, and Bartus. NAVARRE. My Lord, I am advertised from France,\\n   That the Guise hath taken armes against the King,\\n   And that Paris is revolted from his grace. BARTUS. Then hath your grace fit oportunitie,\\n   To shew your love unto the King of France:\\n   Offering him aide against his enemies,\\n   Which cannot but be thankfully receiv'd. NAVARRE. Bartus, it shall be so, poast then to Fraunce,\\n   And there salute his highnesse in our name,\\n   Assure him all the aide we can provide,\\n   Against the Guisians and their complices. Bartus be gone, commend me to his grace,\\n   And tell him ere it be long, Ile visite him. BARTUS. I will my Lord. Exit. NAVARRE. Pleshe. Enter Pleshe. PLESHE. My Lord. NAVARRE. Pleshe, goe muster up our men with speed,\\n   And let them march away to France amaine:\\n   For we must aide the King against the Guise. Be gone I say, tis time that we were there. PLESHE. I goe my Lord. [Exit.] NAVARRE. That wicked Guise I feare me much will be,\\n   The wine of that famous Realme of France:\\n   For his aspiring thoughts aime at the crowne,\\n   He takes his vantage on Religion,\\n   To plant the Pope and popelings in the Realme,\\n   And binde it wholy to the Sea of Rome:\\n   But if that God doe prosper mine attempts,\\n   And send us safely to arrive in France:\\n   Wee'l beat him back, and drive him to his death,\\n   That basely seekes the wine of his Realme.

But when will he come that we may murther him? CAPTAINE. Well then, I see you are resolute. 1. Let us alone, I warrant you. CAPTAINE. Then sirs take your standings within this Chamber,\\n   For anon the Guise will come. ALL. You will give us our money? CAPTAINE.

Come Guise and see thy traiterous guile outreacht,\\n   And perish in the pit thou mad'st for me. The Guise comes to the King. GUISE. Good morrow to your Majestie. KING. Good morrow to my loving Cousin of Guise. How fares it this morning with your excellence? GUISE. I heard your Majestie was scarcely pleasde,\\n   That in the Court I bear so great a traine. KING. They were to blame that said I was displeasde,\\n   And you good Cosin to imagine it. Twere hard with me if I should doubt my kinne,\\n   Or be suspicious of my deerest freends:\\n   Cousin, assure you I am resolute,\\n   Whatever any whisper in mine eares,\\n   Not to suspect disloyaltye in thee,\\n   And so sweet Cuz farwell. Exit King [and Epernoune]. GUISE. So,\\n   Now sues the King for favour to the Guise,\\n   And all his Minions stoup when I commaund:\\n   Why this tis to have an army in the fielde. Now by the holy sacrament I sweare,\\n   As ancient Romanes over their Captive Lords,\\n   So will I triumph over this wanton King,\\n   And he shall follow my proud Chariots wheeles.

       "'\\n\\nSCENE.--{The last cottage at the head of a long glen in County Wicklow. Cottage kitchen; turf fire on the right; a bed near it against the wall\\nwith a body lying on it covered with a sheet. A door is at the other\\nend of the room, with a low table near it, and stools, or wooden chairs. There are a couple of glasses on the table, and a bottle of whisky, as\\nif for a wake, with two cups, a teapot, and a home-made cake. There is\\nanother small door near the bed. Nora Burke is moving about the room,\\nsettling a few things, and lighting candles on the table, looking now\\nand then at the bed with an uneasy look. Some one knocks softly at the\\ndoor. She takes up a stocking with money from the table and puts it in\\nher pocket. Then she opens the door.} TRAMP {Outside.} Good evening to you, lady of the house. NORA\\n\\nGood evening, kindly stranger, it\\'s a wild night, God help you, to be\\nout in the rain falling. TRAMP It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair. NORA Is it walking on your feet, stranger? TRAMP On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below\\nI thought maybe if you\\'d a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner\\nwhere a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.} The Lord have mercy on us all! NORA It doesn\\'t matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain. TRAMP {Coming in slowly and going towards the bed.} Is it departed he\\nis? NORA It is, stranger. He\\'s after dying on me, God forgive him, and there\\nI am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for\\nthe winter. TRAMP {Looking closely at the dead man.} It\\'s a queer look is on him for\\na man that\\'s dead. NORA {Half-humorously.} He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose\\nthem that\\'s queer and they living men will be queer bodies after. TRAMP Isn\\'t it a great wonder you\\'re letting him lie there, and he is\\nnot tidied, or laid out itself? NORA {Coming to the bed.} I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black\\ncurse on me this morning if I\\'ld touch his body the time he\\'ld die\\nsudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it\\'s ten\\nmiles away she lives in the big glen over the hill. TRAMP {Looking at her and nodding slowly.} It\\'s a queer story he\\nwouldn\\'t let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed. NORA He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it\\'s always up on\\nthe hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. {She pulls back a\\nbit of the sheet.} Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it\\'s cold he\\nis surely. TRAMP Is it getting the curse on me you\\'ld be, woman of the house? I\\nwouldn\\'t lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with\\ngold. NORA {Looking uneasily at the body.} Maybe cold would be no sign of\\ndeath with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I\\nknew him,--and every night, stranger,--{she covers up his face and comes\\naway from the bed}; but I\\'m thinking it\\'s dead he is surely, for he\\'s\\ncomplaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the\\ntime he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken\\nwith a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was\\ndestroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and\\nwhen the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great\\ncry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep. TRAMP {Crosses himself.} God rest his soul. NORA {Pouring him out a glass of whisky.} Maybe that would do you better\\nthan the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow. TRAMP The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health. {He drinks.} NORA {Giving him a pipe and tobacco.} I\\'ve no pipes saving his own,\\nstranger, but they\\'re sweet pipes to smoke. TRAMP Thank you kindly, lady of the house. NORA Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest. TRAMP {Filling a pipe and looking about the room.} I\\'ve walked a great\\nway through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I\\nnever seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and\\nthe best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only. NORA Didn\\'t you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when\\nthe sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the\\nneighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me? TRAMP {Drinking.} There\\'s no offence, lady of the house? NORA No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing\\nin the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at\\nall? TRAMP {Sitting down.} I knew rightly. {He lights his pipe so that there\\nis a sharp light beneath his haggard face.} And I was thinking, and I\\ncoming in through the door, that it\\'s many a lone woman would be afeard\\nof the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn\\'t be so lonesome\\nas this place, where there aren\\'t two living souls would see the little\\nlight you have shining from the glass. NORA {Slowly.} I\\'m thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what\\nway I\\'d be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. {She\\nlooks towards the window and lowers her voice.} It\\'s other things than\\nthe like of you, stranger, would make a person afeard. TRAMP {Looking round with a half-shudder.} It is surely, God help us\\nall! NORA {Looking at him for a moment with curiosity.} You\\'re saying that,\\nstranger, as if you were easy afeard. TRAMP {Speaking mournfully.} Is it myself, lady of the house, that does\\nbe walking round in the long nights, and crossing the hills when the fog\\nis on them, the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm, and\\na rabbit as big as a bay horse, and a stack of turf as big as a towering\\nchurch in the city of Dublin? If myself was easily afeard, I\\'m telling\\nyou, it\\'s long ago I\\'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum, or\\nmaybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old\\nshirt, and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy--the Lord have\\nmercy on him--in the year that\\'s gone. NORA {With interest.} You knew Darcy? TRAMP Wasn\\'t I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world? NORA There were great stories of what was heard at that time, but would\\nany one believe the things they do be saying in the glen? TRAMP It was no lie, lady of the house.... I was passing below on a dark\\nnight the like of this night, and the sheep were lying under the ditch\\nand every one of them coughing, and choking, like an old man, with the\\ngreat rain and the fog. Then I heard a thing talking--queer talk, you\\nwouldn\\'t believe at all, and you out of your dreams,--and \"Merciful\\nGod,\" says I, \"if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the\\nthick mist, I\\'m destroyed surely.\" Then I run, and I run, and I run,\\ntill I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk\\nin the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races\\nbeyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was\\nhimself I was after hearing, and I wasn\\'t afeard any more. NORA {Speaking sorrowfully and slowly.} God spare Darcy, he\\'ld always\\nlook in here and he passing up or passing down, and it\\'s very lonesome\\nI was after him a long while {she looks over at the bed and lowers her\\nvoice, speaking very clearly,} and then I got happy again--if it\\'s ever\\nhappy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome. {A short\\npause; then she stands up.} NORA Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you\\ncoming from Aughrim? TRAMP There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he\\nrunning after them this way and that. NORA {With a half-smile.} Far down, stranger? TRAMP A piece only. {She fills the kettle and puts it on the fire.} NORA Maybe, if you\\'re not easy afeard, you\\'ld stay here a short while\\nalone with himself. TRAMP I would surely. A man that\\'s dead can do no hurt. NORA {Speaking with a sort of constraint.} I\\'m going a little back to\\nthe west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another\\nand whistle at that place, and then the young man you\\'re after\\nseeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage\\nbeyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we\\'ld have to be\\ndone, and I\\'m wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the\\nglen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead. TRAMP {Looking at the body in the sheet.} It\\'s myself will go for him,\\nlady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great\\nrain. NORA You wouldn\\'t find your way, stranger, for there\\'s a small path\\nonly, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would\\nbe drowned. {She puts a shawl over her head.} Let you be making yourself\\neasy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it\\'s not long I\\'ll be coming\\nagain. TRAMP {Moving uneasily.} Maybe if you\\'d a piece of a grey thread and a\\nsharp needle--there\\'s great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I\\'ld\\nbe putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I\\'ll\\nbe praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God. NORA {Takes a needle and thread from the front of her dress and gives\\nit to him.} There\\'s the needle, stranger, and I\\'m thinking you won\\'t be\\nlonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn\\'t a dead man itself\\nmore company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and\\nyou not knowing on what thing your mind would stay? TRAMP {Slowly.} It\\'s true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all! {Nora goes out. The Tramp begins stitching one of the tags in his coat,\\nsaying the \"De Profundis\" under his breath. In an instant the sheet is\\ndrawn slowly down, and Dan Burke looks out. The Tramp moves uneasily,\\nthen looks up, and springs to his feet with a movement of terror.} DAN {With a hoarse voice.} Don\\'t be afeard, stranger; a man that\\'s dead\\ncan do no hurt. TRAMP {Trembling.} I meant no harm, your honour; and won\\'t you leave me\\neasy to be saying a little prayer for your soul? {A long whistle is heard outside.} DAN {Sitting up in his bed and speaking fiercely.} Ah, the devil mend\\nher.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman\\ncould whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth? {He looks\\nat the table hurriedly.} I\\'m destroyed with the drouth, and let you\\nbring me a drop quickly before herself will come back. TRAMP {Doubtfully.} Is it not dead you are? DAN How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger? TRAMP {Pouring out the whisky.} What will herself say if she smells the\\nstuff on you, for I\\'m thinking it\\'s not for nothing you\\'re letting on to\\nbe dead? DAN It is not, stranger, but she won\\'t be coming near me at all, and\\nit\\'s not long now I\\'ll be letting on, for I\\'ve a cramp in my back, and\\nmy hip\\'s asleep on me, and there\\'s been the devil\\'s own fly itching my\\nnose. It\\'s near dead I was wanting to sneeze, and you blathering about\\nthe rain, and Darcy {bitterly}--the devil choke him--and the towering\\nchurch. {Crying out impatiently.} Give me that whisky. Would you have\\nherself come back before I taste a drop at all? {Tramp gives him the glass.} DAN {After drinking.} Go over now to that cupboard, and bring me a black\\nstick you\\'ll see in the west corner by the wall. TRAMP {Taking a stick from the cupboard} Is it that? DAN It is, stranger; it\\'s a long time I\\'m keeping that stick for I\\'ve a\\nbad wife in the house. TRAMP {With a queer look.} Is it herself, master of the house, and she a\\ngrand woman to talk? DAN It\\'s herself, surely, it\\'s a bad wife she is--a bad wife for an old\\nman, and I\\'m getting old, God help me, though I\\'ve an arm to me still. {He takes the stick in his hand.} Let you wait now a short while, and\\nit\\'s a great sight you\\'ll see in this room in two hours or three. {He\\nstops to listen.} Is that somebody above? TRAMP {Listening.} There\\'s a voice speaking on the path. DAN Put that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was\\nlying. {He covers himself up hastily.} Be falling to sleep now and don\\'t\\nlet on you know anything, or I\\'ll be having your life. I wouldn\\'t have\\ntold you at all but it\\'s destroyed with the drouth I was. TRAMP {Covering his head.} Have no fear, master of the house. What is it\\nI know of the like of you that I\\'ld be saying a word or putting out my\\nhand to stay you at all? {He goes back to the fire, sits down on a stool with his back to the bed\\nand goes on stitching his coat.} DAN {Under the sheet, querulously.} Stranger. TRAMP {Quickly.} Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I\\'m telling you, they\\'re\\ncoming now at the door. {Nora comes in with Micheal Dara, a tall, innocent young man behind\\nher.} NORA I wasn\\'t long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path. TRAMP You were middling long, lady of the house. NORA There was no sign from himself? TRAMP No sign at all, lady of the house. NORA {To Micheal.} Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on\\nhimself, Micheal Dara, and you\\'ll see it\\'s the truth I\\'m telling you. MICHEAL I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead. {He sits down on a stool next the table facing the tramp. Nora puts the\\nkettle on a lower hook of the pot hooks, and piles turf under it.} NORA {Turning to Tramp.} Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the\\nyoung man, stranger, or {speaking more persuasively} will you go into\\nthe little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I\\'m\\nthinking it\\'s destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the\\ngreat rain. TRAMP Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the\\nhouse? I will not surely. {He takes a drink from his glass which he has\\nbeside him.} And it\\'s none of your tea I\\'m asking either. {He goes on stitching. Nora makes the tea.} MICHEAL {After looking at the tramp rather scornfully for a moment.} That\\'s a poor coat you have, God help you, and I\\'m thinking it\\'s a poor\\ntailor you are with it. TRAMP If it\\'s a poor tailor I am, I\\'m thinking it\\'s a poor herd does be\\nrunning back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen\\nyourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair. {Nora comes back to the table.} NORA {To Micheal in a low voice.} Let you not mind him at all, Micheal\\nDara, he has a drop taken and it\\'s soon he\\'ll be falling asleep. MICHEAL It\\'s no lie he\\'s telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that\\nwilful they were running off into one man\\'s bit of oats, and another\\nman\\'s bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it\\'s more like a\\npack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed,\\nNora Burke, and I\\'m not used to them at all. NORA {Settling the tea things.} There\\'s no one can drive a mountain ewe\\nbut the men do be reared in the Glen Malure, I\\'ve heard them say, and\\nabove by Rathvanna, and the Glen Imaal, men the like of Patch Darcy, God\\nspare his soul, who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one\\nof them, and he not reckoning them at all. MICHEAL {Uneasily.} Is it the man went queer in his head the year that\\'s\\ngone? NORA It is surely. TRAMP {Plaintively.} That was a great man, young fellow, a great man I\\'m\\ntelling you. There was never a lamb from his own ewes he wouldn\\'t know\\nbefore it was marked, and he\\'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and\\nnever catch for his breath. NORA {Turning round quickly.} He was a great man surely, stranger, and\\nisn\\'t it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of\\na dead man, and he mad dying? TRAMP It\\'s the truth I\\'m saying, God spare his soul. {He puts the needle under the collar of his coat, and settles himself\\nto sleep in the chimney-corner. Nora sits down at the table; their backs\\nare turned to the bed.} MICHEAL {Looking at her with a queer look.} I heard tell this day, Nora\\nBurke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and\\npassing down, and I heard them say he\\'ld never past it night or morning\\nwithout speaking with yourself. NORA {In a low voice.} It was no lie you heard, Micheal Dara. MICHEAL I\\'m thinking it\\'s a power of men you\\'re after knowing if it\\'s in\\na lonesome place you live itself. NORA {Giving him his tea.} It\\'s in a lonesome place you do have to be\\ntalking with some one, and looking for some one, in the evening of the\\nday, and if it\\'s a power of men I\\'m after knowing they were fine men,\\nfor I was a hard child to please, and a hard girl to please {she looks\\nat him a little sternly}, and it\\'s a hard woman I am to please this day,\\nMicheal Dara, and it\\'s no lie I\\'m telling you. MICHEAL {Looking over to see that the tramp is asleep, and then pointing\\nto the dead man.} Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took\\nhimself for your man? NORA What way would I live and I an old woman if I didn\\'t marry a man\\nwith a bit of a farm, and cows on it, and sheep on the back hills? MICHEAL {Considering.} That\\'s true, Nora, and maybe it\\'s no fool you\\nwere, for there\\'s good grazing on it, if it is a lonesome place, and I\\'m\\nthinking it\\'s a good sum he\\'s left behind. 28\\n\\nNORA {Taking the stocking with money from her pocket, and putting it on\\nthe table.} I do be thinking in the long nights it was a big fool I was\\nthat time, Micheal Dara, for what good is a bit of a farm with cows on\\nit, and sheep on the back hills, when you do be sitting looking out from\\na door the like of that door, and seeing nothing but the mists rolling\\ndown the bog, and the mists again, and they rolling up the bog, and\\nhearing nothing but the wind crying out in the bits of broken trees were\\nleft from the great storm, and the streams roaring with the rain. MICHEAL {Looking at her uneasily.} What is it ails you, this night, Nora\\nBurke? I\\'ve heard tell it\\'s the like of that talk you do hear from men,\\nand they after being a great while on the back hills. NORA {Putting out the money on the table.} It\\'s a bad night, and a wild\\nnight, Micheal Dara, and isn\\'t it a great while I am at the foot of the\\nback hills, sitting up here boiling food for himself, and food for the\\nbrood sow, and baking a cake when the night falls? {She puts up the\\nmoney, listlessly, in little piles on the table.} Isn\\'t it a long while\\nI am sitting here in the winter and the summer, and the fine spring,\\nwith the young growing behind me and the old passing, saying to myself\\none time, to look on Mary Brien who wasn\\'t that height {holding out\\nher hand}, and I a fine girl growing up, and there she is now with\\ntwo children, and another coming on her in three months or four. {She\\npauses.} MICHEAL {Moving over three of the piles.} That\\'s three pounds we have\\nnow, Nora Burke. NORA {Continuing in the same voice.} And saying to myself another time,\\nto look on Peggy Cavanagh, who had the lightest hand at milking a cow\\nthat wouldn\\'t be easy, or turning a cake, and there she is now walking\\nround on the roads, or sitting in a dirty old house, with no teeth in\\nher mouth, and no sense and no more hair than you\\'ld see on a bit of a\\nhill and they after burning the furze from it. MICHEAL That\\'s five pounds and ten notes, a good sum, surely!... It\\'s\\nnot that way you\\'ll be talking when you marry a young man, Nora Burke,\\nand they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs, and I got\\na grand price, for I\\'m no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are\\ngood. NORA What was it you got? MICHEAL Twenty pound for the lot, Nora Burke.... We\\'ld do right to wait\\nnow till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches, and then\\nyou\\'ll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna, and I\\'ll bring the sheep up\\non the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain, and we won\\'t have\\nanything we\\'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down. NORA {Pouring him out some whisky.} Why would I marry you, Mike Dara? You\\'ll be getting old and I\\'ll be getting old, and in a little while\\nI\\'m telling you, you\\'ll be sitting up in your bed--the way himself was\\nsitting--with a shake in your face, and your teeth falling, and the\\nwhite hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be\\nleaping a gap. {Dan Burke sits up noiselessly from under the sheet, with his hand to\\nhis face. His white hair is sticking out round his head.} NORA {Goes on slowly without hearing him.} It\\'s a pitiful thing to be\\ngetting old, but it\\'s a queer thing surely. It\\'s a queer thing to see\\nan old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough\\nword in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the\\nedge of an oak board you\\'ld have building a door.... God forgive me,\\nMicheal Dara, we\\'ll all be getting old, but it\\'s a queer thing surely. MICHEAL It\\'s too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old\\nman, Nora, and you\\'re talking again like a herd that would be coming\\ndown from the thick mist {he puts his arm round her}, but it\\'s a fine\\nlife you\\'ll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....\\n\\n{Dan sneezes violently. Micheal tries to get to the door, but before\\nhe can do so, Dan jumps out of the bed in queer white clothes, with his\\nstick in his hand, and goes over and puts his back against it.} MICHEAL Son of God deliver us. {Crosses himself, and goes backward across the room.} DAN {Holding up his hand at him.} Now you\\'ll not marry her the time I\\'m\\nrotting below in the Seven Churches, and you\\'ll see the thing I\\'ll give\\nyou will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high. MICHEAL {To Nora.} Get me out of it, Nora, for the love of God. He\\nalways did what you bid him, and I\\'m thinking he would do it now. NORA {Looking at the Tramp.} Is it dead he is or living? DAN {Turning towards her.} It\\'s little you care if it\\'s dead or living I\\nam, but there\\'ll be an end now of your fine times, and all the talk you\\nhave of young men and old men, and of the mist coming up or going down. {He opens the door.} You\\'ll walk out now from that door, Nora Burke,\\nand it\\'s not to-morrow, or the next day, or any day of your life, that\\nyou\\'ll put in your foot through it again. TRAMP {Standing up.} It\\'s a hard thing you\\'re saying for an old man,\\nmaster of the house, and what would the like of her do if you put her\\nout on the roads? DAN Let her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below, and be begging\\nmoney at the cross-road, or selling songs to the men. {To Nora.} Walk\\nout now, Nora Burke, and it\\'s soon you\\'ll be getting old with that life,\\nI\\'m telling you; it\\'s soon your teeth\\'ll be falling and your head\\'ll be\\nthe like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap. {He pauses: she looks round at Micheal.} MICHEAL {Timidly.} There\\'s a fine Union below in Rathdrum. DAN The like of her would never go there.... It\\'s lonesome roads she\\'ll\\nbe going and hiding herself away till the end will come, and they\\nfind her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her, or the big\\nspiders, maybe, and they putting their webs on her, in the butt of a\\nditch. NORA {Angrily.} What way will yourself be that day, Daniel Burke? What\\nway will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave? For it\\'s bad you are living, and it\\'s bad you\\'ll be when you\\'re dead. {She looks at him a moment fiercely, then half turns away and speaks\\nplaintively again.} Yet, if it is itself, Daniel Burke, who can help it\\nat all, and let you be getting up into your bed, and not be taking your\\ndeath with the wind blowing on you, and the rain with it, and you half\\nin your skin. DAN It\\'s proud and happy you\\'ld be if I was getting my death the day I\\nwas shut of yourself. {Pointing to the door.} Let you walk out through\\nthat door, I\\'m telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it\\'s\\nhungry you are, or wanting a bed. TRAMP {Pointing to Micheal.} Maybe himself would take her. NORA What would he do with me now? TRAMP Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth. DAN Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born\\nyourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with\\nher, stranger--if it\\'s raining itself--for it\\'s too much talk you have\\nsurely. TRAMP {Going over to Nora.} We\\'ll be going now, lady of the house--the\\nrain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it\\'ll be a grand morning\\nby the grace of God. NORA What good is a grand morning when I\\'m destroyed surely, and I going\\nout to get my death walking the roads? TRAMP You\\'ll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house,\\nand I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We\\'ll be\\ngoing now, I\\'m telling you, and the time you\\'ll be feeling the cold,\\nand the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind\\nblowing in the glens, you\\'ll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way\\nyou\\'re after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking\\non each day, and it passing you by. You\\'ll be saying one time, \"It\\'s\\na grand evening, by the grace of God,\" and another time, \"It\\'s a wild\\nnight, God help us, but it\\'ll pass surely.\" You\\'ll be saying--\\n\\nDAN {Goes over to them crying out impatiently.} Go out of that door, I\\'m\\ntelling you, and do your blathering below in the glen. {Nora gathers a few things into her shawl.} TRAMP {At the door.} Come along with me now, lady of the house, and it\\'s\\nnot my blather you\\'ll be hearing only, but you\\'ll be hearing the herons\\ncrying out over the black lakes, and you\\'ll be hearing the grouse and\\nthe owls with them, and the larks and the big thrushes when the days\\nare warm, and it\\'s not from the like of them you\\'ll be hearing a talk\\nof getting old like Peggy Cavanagh, and losing the hair off you, and the\\nlight of your eyes, but it\\'s fine songs you\\'ll be hearing when the sun\\ngoes up, and there\\'ll be no old fellow wheezing, the like of a sick\\nsheep, close to your ear. NORA I\\'m thinking it\\'s myself will be wheezing that time with lying down\\nunder the Heavens when the night is cold; but you\\'ve a fine bit of talk,\\nstranger, and it\\'s with yourself I\\'ll go. {She goes towards the door, then turns to Dan.} You think it\\'s a grand\\nthing you\\'re after doing with your letting on to be dead, but what is it\\nat all? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this\\nplace, and she not making a talk with the men passing? And what way\\nwill yourself live from this day, with none to care for you? What is it\\nyou\\'ll have now but a black life, Daniel Burke, and it\\'s not long I\\'m\\ntelling you, till you\\'ll be lying again under that sheet, and you dead\\nsurely. {She goes out with the Tramp. Micheal is slinking after them, but Dan\\nstops him.} DAN Sit down now and take a little taste of the stuff, Micheal Dara. There\\'s a great drouth on me, and the night is young. MICHEAL {Coming back to the table.} And it\\'s very dry I am, surely, with\\nthe fear of death you put on me, and I after driving mountain ewes since\\nthe turn of the day. DAN {Throwing away his stick.} I was thinking to strike you, Micheal\\nDara, but you\\'re a quiet man, God help you, and I don\\'t mind you at all. {He pours out two glasses of whisky, and gives one to Micheal.} DAN Your good health, Micheal Dara. MICHEAL God reward you, Daniel Burke, and may you have a long life, and\\na quiet life, and good health with it. {They drink.} CURTAIN. End of Project Gutenberg\\'s In the Shadow of the Glen, by J.

       "'\\nThe greatest of English dramatists except Shakespeare, the first\\nliterary dictator and poet-laureate, a writer of verse, prose, satire,\\nand criticism who most potently of all the men of his time affected the\\nsubsequent course of English letters: such was Ben Jonson, and as such\\nhis strong personality assumes an interest to us almost unparalleled, at\\nleast in his age. Ben Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the\\nworld Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson\\'s grandfather was of Annandale, over\\nthe Solway, whence he migrated to England. Jonson\\'s father lost his\\nestate under Queen Mary, \"having been cast into prison and forfeited.\" He entered the church, but died a month before his illustrious son was\\nborn, leaving his widow and child in poverty. Jonson\\'s birthplace was\\nWestminster, and the time of his birth early in 1573. He was thus nearly\\nten years Shakespeare\\'s junior, and less well off, if a trifle better\\nborn. But Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage. His\\nmother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was for a\\ntime apprenticed to the trade. As a youth he attracted the attention of\\nthe famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at Westminster School,\\nand there the poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning. Jonson always held Camden in veneration, acknowledging that to him he\\nowed,\\n\\n     \"All that I am in arts, all that I know;\"\\n\\nand dedicating his first dramatic success, \"Every Man in His Humour,\"\\nto him. It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either university,\\nthough Fuller says that he was \"statutably admitted into St. John\\'s\\nCollege, Cambridge.\" He tells us that he took no degree, but was later\\n\"Master of Arts in both the universities, by their favour, not his\\nstudy.\" When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as a soldier, trailing his\\npike in Flanders in the protracted wars of William the Silent against\\nthe Spanish. Jonson was a large and raw-boned lad; he became by his\\nown account in time exceedingly bulky. In chat with his friend William\\nDrummond of Hawthornden, Jonson told how \"in his service in the Low\\nCountries he had, in the face of both the camps, killed an enemy, and\\ntaken opima spolia from him;\" and how \"since his coming to England,\\nbeing appealed to the fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt\\nhim in the arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his.\" Jonson\\'s\\nreach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his prowess\\nlost nothing in the telling. Obviously Jonson was brave, combative, and\\nnot averse to talking of himself and his doings. In 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless. Soon after he married,\\nalmost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare. He told\\nDrummond curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\"; for some\\nyears he lived apart from her in the household of Lord Albany. Yet two\\ntouching epitaphs among Jonson\\'s \"Epigrams,\" \"On my first daughter,\" and\\n\"On my first son,\" attest the warmth of the poet\\'s family affections. The daughter died in infancy, the son of the plague; another son grew up\\nto manhood little credit to his father whom he survived. We know nothing\\nbeyond this of Jonson\\'s domestic life. How soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly \"the theatrical\\nprofession\" we do not know. In 1593, Marlowe made his tragic exit from\\nlife, and Greene, Shakespeare\\'s other rival on the popular stage,\\nhad preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death the year before. Shakespeare already had the running to himself. Jonson appears first in\\nthe employment of Philip Henslowe, the exploiter of several troupes of\\nplayers, manager, and father-in-law of the famous actor, Edward Alleyn. From entries in \"Henslowe\\'s Diary,\" a species of theatrical account book\\nwhich has been handed down to us, we know that Jonson was connected with\\nthe Admiral\\'s men; for he borrowed 4 pounds of Henslowe, July 28, 1597,\\npaying back 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his \"share\" (in what\\nis not altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same year,\\nHenslowe advanced 20s. to him \"upon a book which he showed the plot unto\\nthe company which he promised to deliver unto the company at Christmas\\nnext.\" In the next August Jonson was in collaboration with Chettle and\\nPorter in a play called \"Hot Anger Soon Cold.\" All this points to an\\nassociation with Henslowe of some duration, as no mere tyro would be\\nthus paid in advance upon mere promise. From allusions in Dekker\\'s play,\\n\"Satiromastix,\" it appears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as\\nan actor, and that he \"ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon\" taking\\nat one time the part of Hieronimo in Kyd\\'s famous play, \"The Spanish\\nTragedy.\" By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy\\ncircumstances, had begun to receive recognition. Francis Meres--well\\nknown for his \"Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the\\nGreek, Latin, and Italian Poets,\" printed in 1598, and for his mention\\ntherein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title--accords to Ben Jonson\\na place as one of \"our best in tragedy,\" a matter of some surprise, as\\nno known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date has come down to us. That Jonson was at work on tragedy, however, is proved by the entries in\\nHenslowe of at least three tragedies, now lost, in which he had a\\nhand. These are \"Page of Plymouth,\" \"King Robert II. of Scotland,\"\\nand \"Richard Crookback.\" But all of these came later, on his return to\\nHenslowe, and range from August 1599 to June 1602. Returning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for\\na time Jonson\\'s relations with Henslowe. In a letter to Alleyn, dated\\nSeptember 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one of my\\ncompany that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer], for he is\\nslain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson, bricklayer.\" The last word is perhaps Henslowe\\'s thrust at Jonson in his displeasure\\nrather than a designation of his actual continuance at his trade up to\\nthis time. It is fair to Jonson to remark however, that his adversary\\nappears to have been a notorious fire-eater who had shortly before\\nkilled one Feeke in a similar squabble. Duelling was a frequent\\noccurrence of the time among gentlemen and the nobility; it was an\\nimpudent breach of the peace on the part of a player. This duel is the\\none which Jonson described years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson\\nwas duly arraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted. He was sent to\\nprison and such goods and chattels as he had \"were forfeited.\" It is\\na thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law permitting\\nconvicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit of clergy,\\nJonson might have been hanged for this deed. The circumstance that the\\npoet could read and write saved him; and he received only a brand of the\\nletter \"T,\" for Tyburn, on his left thumb. While in jail Jonson became a\\nRoman Catholic; but he returned to the faith of the Church of England a\\ndozen years later. On his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former associates,\\nJonson offered his services as a playwright to Henslowe\\'s rivals,\\nthe Lord Chamberlain\\'s company, in which Shakespeare was a prominent\\nshareholder. A tradition of long standing, though not susceptible\\nof proof in a court of law, narrates that Jonson had submitted the\\nmanuscript of \"Every Man in His Humour\" to the Chamberlain\\'s men and had\\nreceived from the company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back,\\nread the play himself, and at once accepted it. Whether this story is\\ntrue or not, certain it is that \"Every Man in His Humour\" was accepted\\nby Shakespeare\\'s company and acted for the first time in 1598, with\\nShakespeare taking a part. The evidence of this is contained in the list\\nof actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson\\'s works, 1616. But it is a mistake to infer, because Shakespeare\\'s name stands first\\nin the list of actors and the elder Kno\\'well first in the dramatis\\npersonae, that Shakespeare took that particular part. The order of a\\nlist of Elizabethan players was generally that of their importance or\\npriority as shareholders in the company and seldom if ever corresponded\\nto the list of characters. \"Every Man in His Humour\" was an immediate success, and with it Jonson\\'s\\nreputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time was established\\nonce and for all. This could have been by no means Jonson\\'s earliest\\ncomedy, and we have just learned that he was already reputed one of \"our\\nbest in tragedy.\" Indeed, one of Jonson\\'s extant comedies, \"The Case\\nis Altered,\" but one never claimed by him or published as his, must\\ncertainly have preceded \"Every Man in His Humour\" on the stage. The\\nformer play may be described as a comedy modelled on the Latin plays of\\nPlautus. (It combines, in fact, situations derived from the \"Captivi\"\\nand the \"Aulularia\" of that dramatist). But the pretty story of the\\nbeggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the\\nclassics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had\\nalready popularised on the stage. Jonson never again produced so fresh\\nand lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other respects\\n\"The Case is Altered\" is not a conspicuous play, and, save for the\\nsatirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio Balladino and\\nGabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least characteristic of the\\ncomedies of Jonson. \"Every Man in His Humour,\" probably first acted late in the summer of\\n1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making play;\\nand this view is not unjustified. As to plot, it tells little more than\\nhow an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly\\nstudious son to London, and there observe his life with the gallants of\\nthe time. The real quality of this comedy is in its personages and in\\nthe theory upon which they are conceived. Ben Jonson had theories about\\npoetry and the drama, and he was neither chary in talking of them nor in\\nexperimenting with them in his plays. This makes Jonson, like Dryden\\nin his time, and Wordsworth much later, an author to reckon with;\\nparticularly when we remember that many of Jonson\\'s notions came for\\na time definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English\\npoetry. First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed in\\nrestraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent ungoverned\\nand irresponsible Renaissance spirit. Jonson believed that there was a\\nprofessional way of doing things which might be reached by a study of\\nthe best examples, and he found these examples for the most part among\\nthe ancients. To confine our attention to the drama, Jonson objected to\\nthe amateurishness and haphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and\\nset himself to do something different; and the first and most striking\\nthing that he evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of\\nhumours. As Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote his\\nown words as to \"humour.\" A humour, according to Jonson, was a bias of\\ndisposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which\\n\\n     \"Some one peculiar quality\\n     Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw\\n     All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,\\n     In their confluctions, all to run one way.\" But continuing, Jonson is careful to add:\\n\\n     \"But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,\\n     The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,\\n     A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot\\n     On his French garters, should affect a humour! O, it is more than most ridiculous.\" Jonson\\'s comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage personages\\non the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable simplification\\nof actual life be it observed in passing); and, placing these typified\\ntraits in juxtaposition in their conflict and contrast, struck the\\nspark of comedy. Downright, as his name indicates, is \"a plain squire\";\\nBobadill\\'s humour is that of the braggart who is incidentally, and with\\ndelightfully comic effect, a coward; Brainworm\\'s humour is the finding\\nout of things to the end of fooling everybody: of course he is fooled\\nin the end himself. But it was not Jonson\\'s theories alone that made the\\nsuccess of \"Every Man in His Humour.\" The play is admirably written\\nand each character is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on\\nobservation of the men of the London of the day. Jonson was neither in\\nthis, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that he wrote),\\na supine classicist, urging that English drama return to a slavish\\nadherence to classical conditions. He says as to the laws of the old\\ncomedy (meaning by \"laws,\" such matters as the unities of time and place\\nand the use of chorus): \"I see not then, but we should enjoy the same\\nlicence, or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they\\n[the ancients] did; and not be tied to those strict and regular forms\\nwhich the niceness of a few, who are nothing but form, would thrust upon\\nus.\" \"Every Man in His Humour\" is written in prose, a novel practice\\nwhich Jonson had of his predecessor in comedy, John Lyly. Even the word\\n\"humour\" seems to have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman\\nbefore Jonson\\'s use of it. Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only\\na heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,\\nviewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent\\nspecies of comedy in the language. None the less, Jonson\\'s comedy\\nmerited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in which\\ncomedy long continued to run. To mention only Shakespeare\\'s Falstaff\\nand his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the rest, whether in\\n\"Henry IV.\" or in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" all are conceived in\\nthe spirit of humours. So are the captains, Welsh, Scotch, and Irish\\nof \"Henry V.,\" and Malvolio especially later; though Shakespeare never\\nemployed the method of humours for an important personage. It was not\\nJonson\\'s fault that many of his successors did precisely the thing\\nthat he had reprobated, that is, degrade \"the humour: into an oddity of\\nspeech, an eccentricity of manner, of dress, or cut of beard. There was\\nan anonymous play called \"Every Woman in Her Humour.\" Chapman wrote \"A\\nHumourous Day\\'s Mirth,\" Day, \"Humour Out of Breath,\" Fletcher later,\\n\"The Humourous Lieutenant,\" and Jonson, besides \"Every Man Out of His\\nHumour,\" returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies in\\n\"The Magnetic Lady or Humours Reconciled.\" With the performance of \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" in 1599, by\\nShakespeare\\'s company once more at the Globe, we turn a new page in\\nJonson\\'s career. Despite his many real virtues, if there is one feature\\nmore than any other that distinguishes Jonson, it is his arrogance; and\\nto this may be added his self-righteousness, especially under criticism\\nor satire. \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" is the first of three \"comical\\nsatires\" which Jonson contributed to what Dekker called the poetomachia\\nor war of the theatres as recent critics have named it. This play as a\\nfabric of plot is a very slight affair; but as a satirical picture\\nof the manners of the time, proceeding by means of vivid caricature,\\ncouched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that righteous\\nindignation which must lie at the heart of all true satire--as a\\nrealisation, in short, of the classical ideal of comedy--there had been\\nnothing like Jonson\\'s comedy since the days of Aristophanes. \"Every Man\\nin His Humour,\" like the two plays that follow it, contains two kinds\\nof attack, the critical or generally satiric, levelled at abuses\\nand corruptions in the abstract; and the personal, in which specific\\napplication is made of all this in the lampooning of poets and others,\\nJonson\\'s contemporaries. The method of personal attack by actual\\ncaricature of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama. Aristophanes so lampooned Euripides in \"The Acharnians\" and Socrates in\\n\"The Clouds,\" to mention no other examples; and in English drama this\\nkind of thing is alluded to again and again. What Jonson really did,\\nwas to raise the dramatic lampoon to an art, and make out of a casual\\nburlesque and bit of mimicry a dramatic satire of literary pretensions\\nand permanency. With the arrogant attitude mentioned above and his\\nuncommon eloquence in scorn, vituperation, and invective, it is no\\nwonder that Jonson soon involved himself in literary and even personal\\nquarrels with his fellow-authors. The circumstances of the origin of\\nthis \\'poetomachia\\' are far from clear, and those who have written on the\\ntopic, except of late, have not helped to make them clearer. The origin\\nof the \"war\" has been referred to satirical references, apparently to\\nJonson, contained in \"The Scourge of Villainy,\" a satire in regular form\\nafter the manner of the ancients by John Marston, a fellow playwright,\\nsubsequent friend and collaborator of Jonson\\'s. On the other hand,\\nepigrams of Jonson have been discovered (49, 68, and 100) variously\\ncharging \"playwright\" (reasonably identified with Marston) with\\nscurrility, cowardice, and plagiarism; though the dates of the epigrams\\ncannot be ascertained with certainty. Jonson\\'s own statement of the\\nmatter to Drummond runs: \"He had many quarrels with Marston, beat\\nhim, and took his pistol from him, wrote his \"Poetaster\" on him; the\\nbeginning[s] of them were that Marston represented him on the stage. \"*\\n\\n     * The best account of this whole subject is to be\\n     found in the edition of \"Poetaster\" and \"Satiromastrix\" by\\n     J. H. Penniman in \"Belles Lettres Series\" shortly to appear. See also his earlier work, \"The War of the Theatres,\" 1892,\\n     and the excellent contributions to the subject by H. C. Hart\\n     in \"Notes and Queries,\" and in his edition of Jonson, 1906. Here at least we are on certain ground; and the principals of the\\nquarrel are known. \"Histriomastix,\" a play revised by Marston in 1598,\\nhas been regarded as the one in which Jonson was thus \"represented on\\nthe stage\"; although the personage in question, Chrisogonus, a poet,\\nsatirist, and translator, poor but proud, and contemptuous of the common\\nherd, seems rather a complimentary portrait of Jonson than a caricature. As to the personages actually ridiculed in \"Every Man Out of His\\nHumour,\" Carlo Buffone was formerly thought certainly to be Marston,\\nas he was described as \"a public, scurrilous, and profane jester,\" and\\nelsewhere as the \"grand scourge or second untruss [that is, satirist], of\\nthe time\" (Joseph Hall being by his own boast the first, and Marston\\'s\\nwork being entitled \"The Scourge of Villainy\"). Apparently we must now\\nprefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of whom\\ngossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was \"a bold impertinent\\nfellow... a perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room. So\\none time at a tavern Sir Walter Raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth\\n(that is his upper and nether beard) with hard wax. From him Ben Jonson\\ntakes his Carlo Buffone [\\'i.e. \\', jester] in \"Every Man in His Humour\"\\n[\\'sic\\'].\" Is it conceivable that after all Jonson was ridiculing\\nMarston, and that the point of the satire consisted in an intentional\\nconfusion of \"the grand scourge or second untruss\" with \"the scurrilous\\nand profane\" Chester? We have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify the\\ndifficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the allusions in\\nthese forgotten quarrels. We are on sounder ground of fact in recording\\nother manifestations of Jonson\\'s enmity. In \"The Case is Altered\" there\\nis clear ridicule in the character Antonio Balladino of Anthony Munday,\\npageant-poet of the city, translator of romances and playwright as well. In \"Every Man in His Humour\" there is certainly a caricature of Samuel\\nDaniel, accepted poet of the court, sonneteer, and companion of men of\\nfashion. These men held recognised positions to which Jonson felt his\\ntalents better entitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies. It seems almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his\\nsatire through \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" and \"Cynthia\\'s Revels,\"\\nDaniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as\\nPuntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire once\\nmore. Jonson\\'s literary rivalry of Daniel is traceable again and again,\\nin the entertainments that welcomed King James on his way to London, in\\nthe masques at court, and in the pastoral drama. As to Jonson\\'s personal\\nambitions with respect to these two men, it is notable that he became,\\nnot pageant-poet, but chronologer to the City of London; and that, on\\nthe accession of the new king, he came soon to triumph over Daniel as\\nthe accepted entertainer of royalty. \"Cynthia\\'s Revels,\" the second \"comical satire,\" was acted in 1600, and,\\nas a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible than \"Every\\nMan Out of His Humour.\" Here personal satire seems to have absorbed\\neverything, and while much of the caricature is admirable, especially in\\nthe detail of witty and trenchantly satirical dialogue, the central idea\\nof a fountain of self-love is not very well carried out, and the persons\\nrevert at times to abstractions, the action to allegory. It adds to our\\nwonder that this difficult drama should have been acted by the Children\\nof Queen Elizabeth\\'s Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom Jonson\\nread Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to make plays. Another of these precocious little actors was Salathiel Pavy, who died\\nbefore he was thirteen, already famed for taking the parts of old men. Him Jonson immortalised in one of the sweetest of his epitaphs. An\\ninteresting sidelight is this on the character of this redoubtable\\nand rugged satirist, that he should thus have befriended and tenderly\\nremembered these little theatrical waifs, some of whom (as we know) had\\nbeen literally kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre\\nand whipped to the conning of their difficult parts. To the caricature\\nof Daniel and Munday in \"Cynthia\\'s Revels\" must be added Anaides\\n(impudence), here assuredly Marston, and Asotus (the prodigal),\\ninterpreted as Lodge or, more perilously, Raleigh. Crites, like\\nAsper-Macilente in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" is Jonson\\'s\\nself-complaisant portrait of himself, the just, wholly admirable, and\\njudicious scholar, holding his head high above the pack of the yelping\\ncurs of envy and detraction, but careless of their puny attacks on his\\nperfections with only too mindful a neglect. The third and last of the \"comical satires\" is \"Poetaster,\" acted, once\\nmore, by the Children of the Chapel in 1601, and Jonson\\'s only avowed\\ncontribution to the fray. According to the author\\'s own account, this\\nplay was written in fifteen weeks on a report that his enemies had\\nentrusted to Dekker the preparation of \"Satiromastix, the Untrussing of\\nthe Humorous Poet,\" a dramatic attack upon himself. In this attempt to\\nforestall his enemies Jonson succeeded, and \"Poetaster\" was an immediate\\nand deserved success. While hardly more closely knit in structure than\\nits earlier companion pieces, \"Poetaster\" is planned to lead up to\\nthe ludicrous final scene in which, after a device borrowed from the\\n\"Lexiphanes\" of Lucian, the offending poetaster, Marston-Crispinus, is\\nmade to throw up the difficult words with which he had overburdened his\\nstomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary. In the end Crispinus with\\nhis fellow, Dekker-Demetrius, is bound over to keep the peace and never\\nthenceforward \"malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of\\nQuintus Horatius Flaccus [Jonson] or any other eminent man transcending\\nyou in merit.\" One of the most diverting personages in Jonson\\'s comedy\\nis Captain Tucca. \"His peculiarity\" has been well described by Ward as\\n\"a buoyant blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the\\nmost complete exposure, and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a\\nwalking dictionary of slang.\" It was this character, Captain Tucca, that Dekker hit upon in his reply,\\n\"Satiromastix,\" and he amplified him, turning his abusive vocabulary\\nback upon Jonson and adding \"an immodesty to his dialogue that did not\\nenter into Jonson\\'s conception.\" It has been held, altogether plausibly,\\nthat when Dekker was engaged professionally, so to speak, to write\\na dramatic reply to Jonson, he was at work on a species of chronicle\\nhistory, dealing with the story of Walter Terill in the reign of William\\nRufus. This he hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters\\nsuggested by \"Poetaster,\" and fashioned to convey the satire of his\\nreply. The absurdity of placing Horace in the court of a Norman king is\\nthe result. But Dekker\\'s play is not without its palpable hits at the\\narrogance, the literary pride, and self-righteousness of Jonson-Horace,\\nwhose \"ningle\" or pal, the absurd Asinius Bubo, has recently been shown\\nto figure forth, in all likelihood, Jonson\\'s friend, the poet Drayton. Slight and hastily adapted as is \"Satiromastix,\" especially in a\\ncomparison with the better wrought and more significant satire of\\n\"Poetaster,\" the town awarded the palm to Dekker, not to Jonson; and\\nJonson gave over in consequence his practice of \"comical satire.\" Though\\nJonson was cited to appear before the Lord Chief Justice to answer\\ncertain charges to the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers\\nin \"Poetaster,\" nothing came of this complaint. It may be suspected that\\nmuch of this furious clatter and give-and-take was pure playing to the\\ngallery. The town was agog with the strife, and on no less an authority\\nthan Shakespeare (\"Hamlet,\" ii. 2), we learn that the children\\'s company\\n(acting the plays of Jonson) did \"so berattle the common stages... that\\nmany, wearing rapiers, are afraid of goose-quills, and dare scarce come\\nthither.\" Several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less part\\nin the war of the theatres. Among them the most important is a college\\nplay, entitled \"The Return from Parnassus,\" dating 1601-02. In it a\\nmuch-quoted passage makes Burbage, as a character, declare: \"Why here\\'s\\nour fellow Shakespeare puts them all down; aye and Ben Jonson, too. O\\nthat Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow; he brought up Horace, giving the\\npoets a pill, but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that\\nmade him bewray his credit.\" Was Shakespeare then concerned in this\\nwar of the stages? And what could have been the nature of this \"purge\"? Among several suggestions, \"Troilus and Cressida\" has been thought by\\nsome to be the play in which Shakespeare thus \"put down\" his friend,\\nJonson. A wiser interpretation finds the \"purge\" in \"Satiromastix,\"\\nwhich, though not written by Shakespeare, was staged by his company,\\nand therefore with his approval and under his direction as one of the\\nleaders of that company. The last years of the reign of Elizabeth thus saw Jonson recognised as\\na dramatist second only to Shakespeare, and not second even to him as\\na dramatic satirist. But Jonson now turned his talents to new fields. Plays on subjects derived from classical story and myth had held the\\nstage from the beginning of the drama, so that Shakespeare was making\\nno new departure when he wrote his \"Julius Caesar\" about 1600. Therefore\\nwhen Jonson staged \"Sejanus,\" three years later and with Shakespeare\\'s\\ncompany once more, he was only following in the elder dramatist\\'s\\nfootsteps. But Jonson\\'s idea of a play on classical history, on the one\\nhand, and Shakespeare\\'s and the elder popular dramatists, on the other,\\nwere very different. Heywood some years before had put five straggling\\nplays on the stage in quick succession, all derived from stories in Ovid\\nand dramatised with little taste or discrimination. Shakespeare had\\na finer conception of form, but even he was contented to take all his\\nancient history from North\\'s translation of Plutarch and dramatise his\\nsubject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and a classical\\nantiquarian. He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness, and wrote\\nhis \"Sejanus\" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius, and\\nother authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and his\\natmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in the\\nmargin when he came to print. \"Sejanus\" is a tragedy of genuine dramatic\\npower in which is told with discriminating taste the story of the\\nhaughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical overthrow. Our drama\\npresents no truer nor more painstaking representation of ancient\\nRoman life than may be found in Jonson\\'s \"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline his\\nConspiracy,\" which followed in 1611. A passage in the address of the\\nformer play to the reader, in which Jonson refers to a collaboration\\nin an earlier version, has led to the surmise that Shakespeare may have\\nbeen that \"worthier pen.\" There is no evidence to determine the matter. In 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman and Marston\\nin the admirable comedy of London life entitled \"Eastward Hoe.\" In\\nthe previous year, Marston had dedicated his \"Malcontent,\" in terms\\nof fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the wounds of the war of the\\ntheatres must have been long since healed. Between Jonson and Chapman\\nthere was the kinship of similar scholarly ideals. The two continued\\nfriends throughout life. \"Eastward Hoe\" achieved the extraordinary\\npopularity represented in a demand for three issues in one year. But\\nthis was not due entirely to the merits of the play. In its earliest\\nversion a passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory\\nto his nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but the\\nmatter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had influence at\\ncourt. With the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and successful\\ncareer as a writer of masques. He wrote more masques than all his\\ncompetitors together, and they are of an extraordinary variety\\nand poetic excellence. Jonson did not invent the masque; for such\\npremeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a court ball had\\nbeen known and practised in varying degrees of elaboration long before\\nhis time. But Jonson gave dramatic value to the masque, especially in\\nhis invention of the antimasque, a comedy or farcical element of relief,\\nentrusted to professional players or dancers. He enhanced, as well, the\\nbeauty and dignity of those portions of the masque in which noble lords\\nand ladies took their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and\\nartistic grouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show. On the mechanical\\nand scenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in\\nInigo Jones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised\\nthe standard of stage representation in the England of his day. Jonson\\ncontinued active in the service of the court in the writing of masques\\nand other entertainments far into the reign of King Charles; but,\\ntowards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his life, and the two\\ntesty old men appear to have become not only a constant irritation to\\neach other, but intolerable bores at court. In \"Hymenaei,\" \"The Masque\\nof Queens,\" \"Love Freed from Ignorance,\" \"Lovers made Men,\" \"Pleasure\\nReconciled to Virtue,\" and many more will be found Jonson\\'s aptitude,\\nhis taste, his poetry and inventiveness in these by-forms of the drama;\\nwhile in \"The Masque of Christmas,\" and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\"\\nespecially, is discoverable that power of broad comedy which, at\\ncourt as well as in the city, was not the least element of Jonson\\'s\\ncontemporary popularity. But Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he turned to\\nthe amusement of King James. In 1605 \"Volpone\" was produced, \"The Silent\\nWoman\" in 1609, \"The Alchemist\" in the following year. These comedies,\\nwith \"Bartholomew Fair,\" 1614, represent Jonson at his height, and for\\nconstructive cleverness, character successfully conceived in the manner\\nof caricature, wit and brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in\\nEnglish drama. \"Volpone, or the Fox,\" is, in a sense, a transition play\\nfrom the dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy\\nrepresented in the plays named above. Its subject is a struggle of\\nwit applied to chicanery; for among its dramatis personae, from the\\nvillainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore (the\\nvulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little raven), to Sir\\nPolitic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a virtuous character in\\nthe play. Question has been raised as to whether a story so forbidding\\ncan be considered a comedy, for, although the plot ends in the\\ndiscomfiture and imprisonment of the most vicious, it involves no mortal\\ncatastrophe. But Jonson was on sound historical ground, for \"Volpone\"\\nis conceived far more logically on the lines of the ancients\\' theory\\nof comedy than was ever the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however\\nrepulsive we may find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the\\nworld into the rogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains\\nwith roguery and innocence with folly, admires the former while\\ninconsistently punishing them. \"The Silent Woman\" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious\\nconstruction. The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a\\nheartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take to\\nhimself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in the end,\\nturns out neither silent nor a woman at all. In \"The Alchemist,\" again,\\nwe have the utmost cleverness in construction, the whole fabric building\\nclimax on climax, witty, ingenious, and so plausibly presented that we\\nforget its departures from the possibilities of life. In \"The Alchemist\"\\nJonson represented, none the less to the life, certain sharpers of\\nthe metropolis, revelling in their shrewdness and rascality and in the\\nvariety of the stupidity and wickedness of their victims. We may object\\nto the fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple\\nof honesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is\\napproved in the end and rewarded. The comedy is so admirably written and\\ncontrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike distinctness\\nin their several kinds, and the whole is animated with such verve and\\nresourcefulness that \"The Alchemist\" is a new marvel every time it is\\nread. Lastly of this group comes the tremendous comedy, \"Bartholomew\\nFair,\" less clear cut, less definite, and less structurally worthy\\nof praise than its three predecessors, but full of the keenest and\\ncleverest of satire and inventive to a degree beyond any English comedy\\nsave some other of Jonson\\'s own. It is in \"Bartholomew Fair\" that we are\\npresented to the immortal caricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land\\nBusy, and the Littlewits that group about him, and it is in this\\nextraordinary comedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this\\ndanger, loosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James\\nin \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed.\" Another comedy of less merit is \"The\\nDevil is an Ass,\" acted in 1616. It was the failure of this play that\\ncaused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a period of\\nnearly ten years. \"Volpone\" was laid as to scene in Venice. Whether because of the success\\nof \"Eastward Hoe\" or for other reasons, the other three comedies declare\\nin the words of the prologue to \"The Alchemist\":\\n\\n     \"Our scene is London, \\'cause we would make known\\n     No country\\'s mirth is better than our own.\" Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for\\ncollected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the scene\\nof \"Every Man in His Humour\" from Florence to London also, converting\\nSignior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno\\'well, Prospero to Master Welborn,\\nand Hesperida to Dame Kitely \"dwelling i\\' the Old Jewry.\" In his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards caricature,\\nJonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing from the life about\\nhim with an experience and insight rare in any generation. A happy\\ncomparison has been suggested between Ben Jonson and Charles Dickens. Both were men of the people, lowly born and hardly bred. Each knew\\nthe London of his time as few men knew it; and each represented it\\nintimately and in elaborate detail. Both men were at heart moralists,\\nseeking the truth by the exaggerated methods of humour and caricature;\\nperverse, even wrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and\\nlargeness of heart, and when all has been said--though the Elizabethan\\nran to satire, the Victorian to sentimentality--leaving the world better\\nfor the art that they practised in it. In 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his\\nplays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective\\nedition. This was an unusual thing at the time and had been attempted\\nby no dramatist before Jonson. This volume published, in a carefully\\nrevised text, all the plays thus far mentioned, excepting \"The Case is\\nAltered,\" which Jonson did not acknowledge, \"Bartholomew Fair,\" and \"The\\nDevil is an Ass,\" which was written too late. It included likewise a\\nbook of some hundred and thirty odd \"Epigrams,\" in which form of brief\\nand pungent writing Jonson was an acknowledged master; \"The Forest,\" a\\nsmaller collection of lyric and occasional verse and some ten \"Masques\"\\nand \"Entertainments.\" In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate\\nwith a pension of one hundred marks a year. This, with his fees and\\nreturns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his plays\\nmust have formed the bulk of his income. The poet appears to have done\\ncertain literary hack-work for others, as, for example, parts of the\\nPunic Wars contributed to Raleigh\\'s \"History of the World.\" We know\\nfrom a story, little to the credit of either, that Jonson accompanied\\nRaleigh\\'s son abroad in the capacity of a tutor. In 1618 Jonson was\\ngranted the reversion of the office of Master of the Revels, a post\\nfor which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did not live to enjoy its\\nperquisites. Jonson was honoured with degrees by both universities,\\nthough when and under what circumstances is not known. It has been said\\nthat he narrowly escaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists\\nof the day averred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate\\nhand. Worse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson. From 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced\\nnothing for the stage. But he \"prosecuted\" what he calls \"his wonted\\nstudies\" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as by report,\\none of the most learned men of his time. Jonson\\'s theory of authorship\\ninvolved a wide acquaintance with books and \"an ability,\" as he put it,\\n\"to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use.\" Accordingly Jonson read not only the Greek and Latin classics down to\\nthe lesser writers, but he acquainted himself especially with the Latin\\nwritings of his learned contemporaries, their prose as well as their\\npoetry, their antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid\\nlearning. Though a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of\\nbooks. He told Drummond that \"the Earl of Pembroke sent him 20 pounds\\nevery first day of the new year to buy new books.\" Unhappily, in 1623,\\nhis library was destroyed by fire, an accident serio-comically described\\nin his witty poem, \"An Execration upon Vulcan.\" Yet even now a book\\nturns up from time to time in which is inscribed, in fair large Italian\\nlettering, the name, Ben Jonson. With respect to Jonson\\'s use of his\\nmaterial, Dryden said memorably of him: \"[He] was not only a professed\\nimitator of Horace, but a learned plagiary of all the others; you track\\nhim everywhere in their snow.... But he has done his robberies so openly\\nthat one sees he fears not to be taxed by any law. He invades authors\\nlike a monarch, and what would be theft in other poets is only victory\\nin him.\" And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided himself, and\\njustly, on his originality. In \"Catiline,\" he not only uses Sallust\\'s\\naccount of the conspiracy, but he models some of the speeches of Cicero\\non the Roman orator\\'s actual words. In \"Poetaster,\" he lifts a whole\\nsatire out of Horace and dramatises it effectively for his purposes. The\\nsophist Libanius suggests the situation of \"The Silent Woman\"; a Latin\\ncomedy of Giordano Bruno, \"Il Candelaio,\" the relation of the dupes\\nand the sharpers in \"The Alchemist,\" the \"Mostellaria\" of Plautus, its\\nadmirable opening scene. But Jonson commonly bettered his sources, and\\nputting the stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed\\nmade it thenceforward to all time current and his own. The lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a peculiar\\nmerit. His theory demanded design and the perfection of literary finish. He was furthest from the rhapsodist and the careless singer of an\\nidle day; and he believed that Apollo could only be worthily served in\\nsinging robes and laurel crowned. And yet many of Jonson\\'s lyrics will\\nlive as long as the language. Who does not know \"Queen and huntress,\\nchaste and fair.\" \"Drink to me only with thine eyes,\" or \"Still to be\\nneat, still to be dressed\"? Beautiful in form, deft and graceful in\\nexpression, with not a word too much or one that bears not its part\\nin the total effect, there is yet about the lyrics of Jonson a\\ncertain stiffness and formality, a suspicion that they were not quite\\nspontaneous and unbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak,\\nwith disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual\\nthought is on greater things. It is for these reasons that Jonson is\\neven better in the epigram and in occasional verse where rhetorical\\nfinish and pointed wit less interfere with the spontaneity and emotion\\nwhich we usually associate with lyrical poetry. There are no such\\nepitaphs as Ben Jonson\\'s, witness the charming ones on his own children,\\non Salathiel Pavy, the child-actor, and many more; and this even though\\nthe rigid law of mine and thine must now restore to William Browne of\\nTavistock the famous lines beginning: \"Underneath this sable hearse.\" Jonson is unsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment,\\nseldom falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet\\nshowing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others, a\\ndiscriminating taste and a generous personal regard. There was no man in\\nEngland of his rank so well known and universally beloved as Ben Jonson. The list of his friends, of those to whom he had written verses, and\\nthose who had written verses to him, includes the name of every man of\\nprominence in the England of King James. And the tone of many of these\\nproductions discloses an affectionate familiarity that speaks for the\\namiable personality and sound worth of the laureate. In 1619, growing\\nunwieldy through inactivity, Jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a\\njourney afoot to Scotland. On his way thither and back he was hospitably\\nreceived at the houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends\\nhad recommended him. When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met to\\ngrant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of Scottish\\npoets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest at Hawthornden. Some of the noblest of Jonson\\'s poems were inspired by friendship. Such is the fine \"Ode to the memory of Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry\\nMoryson,\" and that admirable piece of critical insight and filial\\naffection, prefixed to the first Shakespeare folio, \"To the memory of\\nmy beloved master, William Shakespeare, and what he hath left us,\" to\\nmention only these. Nor can the earlier \"Epode,\" beginning \"Not to know\\nvice at all,\" be matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own\\nwise and stately age. But if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his folio\\nand up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from inactive;\\nfor year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness continued to\\ncontribute to the masquing and entertainment at court. In \"The Golden\\nAge Restored,\" Pallas turns the Iron Age with its attendant evils into\\nstatues which sink out of sight; in \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\"\\nAtlas figures represented as an old man, his shoulders covered with\\nsnow, and Comus, \"the god of cheer or the belly,\" is one of the\\ncharacters, a circumstance which an imaginative boy of ten, named John\\nMilton, was not to forget. \"Pan\\'s Anniversary,\" late in the reign\\nof James, proclaimed that Jonson had not yet forgotten how to write\\nexquisite lyrics, and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" displayed the old\\ndrollery and broad humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable. These, too, and the earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo\\nRoom of the Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of\\nEnglish literary Bohemia. We hear of a room blazoned about with Jonson\\'s\\nown judicious \"Leges Convivales\" in letters of gold, of a company made\\nup of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly attached to their\\nveteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions, affections, and enmities. And we hear, too, of valorous potations; but in the words of Herrick\\naddressed to his master, Jonson, at the Devil Tavern, as at the Dog, the\\nTriple Tun, and at the Mermaid,\\n\\n     \"We such clusters had\\n     As made us nobly wild, not mad,\\n     And yet each verse of thine\\n     Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\" But the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,\\nthough Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet returned\\nto the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, \"The Staple of News,\"\\n\"The New Inn,\" \"The Magnetic Lady,\" and \"The Tale of a Tub,\" the last\\ndoubtless revised from a much earlier comedy. None of these plays met\\nwith any marked success, although the scathing generalisation of Dryden\\nthat designated them \"Jonson\\'s dotages\" is unfair to their genuine\\nmerits. Thus the idea of an office for the gathering, proper dressing,\\nand promulgation of news (wild flight of the fancy in its time) was\\nan excellent subject for satire on the existing absurdities among\\nnewsmongers; although as much can hardly be said for \"The Magnetic\\nLady,\" who, in her bounty, draws to her personages of differing humours\\nto reconcile them in the end according to the alternative title, or\\n\"Humours Reconciled.\" These last plays of the old dramatist revert to\\ncaricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more than\\never present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon, especially\\nof his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears unworthily to have used\\nhis influence at court against the broken-down old poet. And now disease\\nclaimed Jonson, and he was bedridden for months. He had succeeded\\nMiddleton in 1628 as Chronologer to the City of London, but lost the\\npost for not fulfilling its duties. King Charles befriended him, and\\neven commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;\\nand he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and devoted\\nfriends among the younger poets who were proud to be \"sealed of the\\ntribe of Ben.\" Jonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which\\nhe had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in its\\nvarious parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642. It included all the plays\\nmentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, excepting \"The Case is Altered;\"\\nthe masques, some fifteen, that date between 1617 and 1630; another\\ncollection of lyrics and occasional poetry called \"Underwoods\", including\\nsome further entertainments; a translation of \"Horace\\'s Art of Poetry\"\\n(also published in a vicesimo quarto in 1640), and certain fragments and\\ningatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself. These\\nlast comprise the fragment (less than seventy lines) of a tragedy called\\n\"Mortimer his Fall,\" and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty\\nand poetic spirit, \"The Sad Shepherd.\" There is also the exceedingly\\ninteresting \"English Grammar\" \"made by Ben Jonson for the benefit of all\\nstrangers out of his observation of the English language now spoken and\\nin use,\" in Latin and English; and \"Timber, or Discoveries\" \"made upon\\nmen and matter as they have flowed out of his daily reading, or had\\ntheir reflux to his peculiar notion of the times.\" The \"Discoveries,\"\\nas it is usually called, is a commonplace book such as many literary\\nmen have kept, in which their reading was chronicled, passages that took\\ntheir fancy translated or transcribed, and their passing opinions noted. Many passages of Jonson\\'s \"Discoveries\" are literal translations from\\nthe authors he chanced to be reading, with the reference, noted or not,\\nas the accident of the moment prescribed. At times he follows the line\\nof Macchiavelli\\'s argument as to the nature and conduct of princes; at\\nothers he clarifies his own conception of poetry and poets by recourse\\nto Aristotle. He finds a choice paragraph on eloquence in Seneca the\\nelder and applies it to his own recollection of Bacon\\'s power as an\\norator; and another on facile and ready genius, and translates it,\\nadapting it to his recollection of his fellow-playwright,\\nShakespeare. To call such passages--which Jonson never intended for\\npublication--plagiarism, is to obscure the significance of words. To disparage his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of\\nscholarship. Jonson\\'s prose, both in his dramas, in the descriptive\\ncomments of his masques, and in the \"Discoveries,\" is characterised by\\nclarity and vigorous directness, nor is it wanting in a fine sense of\\nform or in the subtler graces of diction. When Jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his\\nmemory. But the Civil War was at hand, and the project failed. A\\nmemorial, not insufficient, was carved on the stone covering his grave\\nin one of the aisles of Westminster Abbey:\\n\\n\"O rare Ben Jonson.\" FELIX E. SCHELLING.

VOLPONE; OR, THE FOX\\n\\nBy Ben Jonson\\n\\n\\nTO THE MOST NOBLE AND MOST EQUAL SISTERS,\\n\\nTHE TWO FAMOUS UNIVERSITIES,\\n\\nFOR THEIR LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE SHEWN TO HIS POEM IN THE PRESENTATION,\\n\\nBEN JONSON,\\n\\nTHE GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGER,\\n\\nDEDICATES BOTH IT AND HIMSELF. Never, most equal Sisters, had any man a wit so presently excellent, as\\nthat it could raise itself; but there must come both matter, occasion,\\ncommenders, and favourers to it. If this be true, and that the fortune\\nof all writers doth daily prove it, it behoves the careful to provide\\nwell towards these accidents; and, having acquired them, to preserve\\nthat part of reputation most tenderly, wherein the benefit of a friend\\nis also defended. Hence is it, that I now render myself grateful, and am\\nstudious to justify the bounty of your act; to which, though your mere\\nauthority were satisfying, yet it being an age wherein poetry and the\\nprofessors of it hear so ill on all sides, there will a reason be looked\\nfor in the subject. It is certain, nor can it with any forehead be\\nopposed, that the too much license of poetasters in this time, hath much\\ndeformed their mistress; that, every day, their manifold and manifest\\nignorance doth stick unnatural reproaches upon her: but for their\\npetulancy, it were an act of the greatest injustice, either to let\\nthe learned suffer, or so divine a skill (which indeed should not be\\nattempted with unclean hands) to fall under the least contempt. For,\\nif men will impartially, and not asquint, look toward the offices\\nand function of a poet, they will easily conclude to themselves the\\nimpossibility of any man\\'s being the good poet, without first being a\\ngood man. He that is said to be able to inform young men to all good\\ndisciplines, inflame grown men to all great virtues, keep old men in\\ntheir best and supreme state, or, as they decline to childhood, recover\\nthem to their first strength; that comes forth the interpreter and\\narbiter of nature, a teacher of things divine no less than human, a\\nmaster in manners; and can alone, or with a few, effect the business\\nof mankind: this, I take him, is no subject for pride and ignorance\\nto exercise their railing rhetoric upon. But it will here be hastily\\nanswered, that the writers of these days are other things; that not only\\ntheir manners, but their natures, are inverted, and nothing remaining\\nwith them of the dignity of poet, but the abused name, which every\\nscribe usurps; that now, especially in dramatic, or, as they term it,\\nstage-poetry, nothing but ribaldry, profanation, blasphemy, all license\\nof offence to God and man is practised. I dare not deny a great part of\\nthis, and am sorry I dare not, because in some men\\'s abortive features\\n(and would they had never boasted the light) it is over-true; but that\\nall are embarked in this bold adventure for hell, is a most uncharitable\\nthought, and, uttered, a more malicious slander. For my particular, I\\ncan, and from a most clear conscience, affirm, that I have ever trembled\\nto think toward the least profaneness; have loathed the use of such\\nfoul and unwashed bawdry, as is now made the food of the scene: and,\\nhowsoever I cannot escape from some, the imputation of sharpness, but\\nthat they will say, I have taken a pride, or lust, to be bitter, and not\\nmy youngest infant but hath come into the world with all his teeth;\\nI would ask of these supercilious politics, what nation, society, or\\ngeneral order or state, I have provoked? What public person? Whether I\\nhave not in all these preserved their dignity, as mine own person, safe? My works are read, allowed, (I speak of those that are intirely mine,)\\nlook into them, what broad reproofs have I used? where have I been\\nparticular? where personal? except to a mimic, cheater, bawd, or\\nbuffoon, creatures, for their insolencies, worthy to be taxed? yet to\\nwhich of these so pointingly, as he might not either ingenuously have\\nconfest, or wisely dissembled his disease? But it is not rumour can make\\nmen guilty, much less entitle me to other men\\'s crimes. I know, that\\nnothing can be so innocently writ or carried, but may be made obnoxious\\nto construction; marry, whilst I bear mine innocence about me, I fear\\nit not. Application is now grown a trade with many; and there are that\\nprofess to have a key for the decyphering of every thing: but let wise\\nand noble persons take heed how they be too credulous, or give leave to\\nthese invading interpreters to be over-familiar with their fames, who\\ncunningly, and often, utter their own virulent malice, under other men\\'s\\nsimplest meanings. As for those that will (by faults which charity hath\\nraked up, or common honesty concealed) make themselves a name with the\\nmultitude, or, to draw their rude and beastly claps, care not whose\\nliving faces they intrench with their petulant styles, may they do it\\nwithout a rival, for me! I choose rather to live graved in obscurity,\\nthan share with them in so preposterous a fame. Nor can I blame the\\nwishes of those severe and wise patriots, who providing the hurts these\\nlicentious spirits may do in a state, desire rather to see fools and\\ndevils, and those antique relics of barbarism retrieved, with all other\\nridiculous and exploded follies, than behold the wounds of private\\nmen, of princes and nations: for, as Horace makes Trebatius speak among\\nthese,\\n\\n   \"Sibi quisque timet, quanquam est intactus, et odit.\" And men may justly impute such rages, if continued, to the writer, as\\nhis sports. The increase of which lust in liberty, together with the\\npresent trade of the stage, in all their miscelline interludes, what\\nlearned or liberal soul doth not already abhor? where nothing but the\\nfilth of the time is uttered, and with such impropriety of phrase, such\\nplenty of solecisms, such dearth of sense, so bold prolepses, so racked\\nmetaphors, with brothelry, able to violate the ear of a pagan, and\\nblasphemy, to turn the blood of a Christian to water. I cannot but be\\nserious in a cause of this nature, wherein my fame, and the reputation\\nof divers honest and learned are the question; when a name so full of\\nauthority, antiquity, and all great mark, is, through their insolence,\\nbecome the lowest scorn of the age; and those men subject to the\\npetulancy of every vernaculous orator, that were wont to be the care of\\nkings and happiest monarchs. This it is that hath not only rapt me to\\npresent indignation, but made me studious heretofore, and by all my\\nactions, to stand off from them; which may most appear in this my latest\\nwork, which you, most learned Arbitresses, have seen, judged, and to\\nmy crown, approved; wherein I have laboured for their instruction and\\namendment, to reduce not only the ancient forms, but manners of the\\nscene, the easiness, the propriety, the innocence, and last, the\\ndoctrine, which is the principal end of poesie, to inform men in the\\nbest reason of living. And though my catastrophe may, in the strict\\nrigour of comic law, meet with censure, as turning back to my promise;\\nI desire the learned and charitable critic, to have so much faith in\\nme, to think it was done of industry: for, with what ease I could have\\nvaried it nearer his scale (but that I fear to boast my own faculty) I\\ncould here insert. But my special aim being to put the snaffle in their\\nmouths, that cry out, We never punish vice in our interludes, etc., I\\ntook the more liberty; though not without some lines of example, drawn\\neven in the ancients themselves, the goings out of whose comedies are\\nnot always joyful, but oft times the bawds, the servants, the rivals,\\nyea, and the masters are mulcted; and fitly, it being the office of a\\ncomic poet to imitate justice, and instruct to life, as well as purity\\nof language, or stir up gentle affections; to which I shall take the\\noccasion elsewhere to speak. For the present, most reverenced Sisters, as I have cared to be thankful\\nfor your affections past, and here made the understanding acquainted\\nwith some ground of your favours; let me not despair their continuance,\\nto the maturing of some worthier fruits; wherein, if my muses be true to\\nme, I shall raise the despised head of poetry again, and stripping her\\nout of those rotten and base rags wherewith the times have adulterated\\nher form, restore her to her primitive habit, feature, and majesty,\\nand render her worthy to be embraced and kist of all the great and\\nmaster-spirits of our world. As for the vile and slothful, who never\\naffected an act worthy of celebration, or are so inward with their own\\nvicious natures, as they worthily fear her, and think it an high point\\nof policy to keep her in contempt, with their declamatory and windy\\ninvectives; she shall out of just rage incite her servants (who are\\ngenus irritabile) to spout ink in their faces, that shall eat farther\\nthan their marrow into their fames; and not Cinnamus the barber, with\\nhis art, shall be able to take out the brands; but they shall live, and\\nbe read, till the wretches die, as things worst deserving of themselves\\nin chief, and then of all mankind.

This we were bid to credit from our poet,\\n     Whose true scope, if you would know it,\\n     In all his poems still hath been this measure,\\n     To mix profit with your pleasure;\\n     And not as some, whose throats their envy failing,\\n     Cry hoarsely, All he writes is railing:\\n     And when his plays come forth, think they can flout them,\\n     With saying, he was a year about them.

ACT 1. SCENE 1.1. A ROOM IN VOLPONE\\'S HOUSE. ENTER VOLPONE AND MOSCA. VOLP: Good morning to the day; and next, my gold:\\n     Open the shrine, that I may see my Saint. [MOSCA WITHDRAWS THE CURTAIN, AND DISCOVERS PILES OF GOLD,\\n     PLATE, JEWELS, ETC.] Hail the world\\'s soul, and mine! more glad than is\\n     The teeming earth to see the long\\'d-for sun\\n     Peep through the horns of the celestial Ram,\\n     Am I, to view thy splendour darkening his;\\n     That lying here, amongst my other hoards,\\n     Shew\\'st like a flame by night; or like the day\\n     Struck out of chaos, when all darkness fled\\n     Unto the centre. O thou son of Sol,\\n     But brighter than thy father, let me kiss,\\n     With adoration, thee, and every relick\\n     Of sacred treasure, in this blessed room. Well did wise poets, by thy glorious name,\\n     Title that age which they would have the best;\\n     Thou being the best of things: and far transcending\\n     All style of joy, in children, parents, friends,\\n     Or any other waking dream on earth:\\n     Thy looks when they to Venus did ascribe,\\n     They should have given her twenty thousand Cupids;\\n     Such are thy beauties and our loves! Dear saint,\\n     Riches, the dumb God, that giv\\'st all men tongues;\\n     That canst do nought, and yet mak\\'st men do all things;\\n     The price of souls; even hell, with thee to boot,\\n     Is made worth heaven. Thou art virtue, fame,\\n     Honour, and all things else. Who can get thee,\\n     He shall be noble, valiant, honest, wise,--\\n\\n     MOS: And what he will, sir. Riches are in fortune\\n     A greater good than wisdom is in nature. VOLP: True, my beloved Mosca. Yet I glory\\n     More in the cunning purchase of my wealth,\\n     Than in the glad possession; since I gain\\n     No common way; I use no trade, no venture;\\n     I wound no earth with plough-shares; fat no beasts,\\n     To feed the shambles; have no mills for iron,\\n     Oil, corn, or men, to grind them into powder:\\n     I blow no subtle glass; expose no ships\\n     To threat\\'nings of the furrow-faced sea;\\n     I turn no monies in the public bank,\\n     Nor usure private. MOS: No sir, nor devour\\n     Soft prodigals. You shall have some will swallow\\n     A melting heir as glibly as your Dutch\\n     Will pills of butter, and ne\\'er purge for it;\\n     Tear forth the fathers of poor families\\n     Out of their beds, and coffin them alive\\n     In some kind clasping prison, where their bones\\n     May be forth-coming, when the flesh is rotten:\\n     But your sweet nature doth abhor these courses;\\n     You lothe the widdow\\'s or the orphan\\'s tears\\n     Should wash your pavements, or their piteous cries\\n     Ring in your roofs, and beat the air for vengeance. VOLP: Right, Mosca; I do lothe it. MOS: And besides, sir,\\n     You are not like a thresher that doth stand\\n     With a huge flail, watching a heap of corn,\\n     And, hungry, dares not taste the smallest grain,\\n     But feeds on mallows, and such bitter herbs;\\n     Nor like the merchant, who hath fill\\'d his vaults\\n     With Romagnia, and rich Candian wines,\\n     Yet drinks the lees of Lombard\\'s vinegar:\\n     You will not lie in straw, whilst moths and worms\\n     Feed on your sumptuous hangings and soft beds;\\n     You know the use of riches, and dare give now\\n     From that bright heap, to me, your poor observer,\\n     Or to your dwarf, or your hermaphrodite,\\n     Your eunuch, or what other household-trifle\\n     Your pleasure allows maintenance. VOLP: Hold thee, Mosca,\\n     [GIVES HIM MONEY.] Take of my hand; thou strik\\'st on truth in all,\\n     And they are envious term thee parasite. Call forth my dwarf, my eunuch, and my fool,\\n     And let them make me sport. [EXIT MOS.] What should I do,\\n     But cocker up my genius, and live free\\n     To all delights my fortune calls me to? I have no wife, no parent, child, ally,\\n     To give my substance to; but whom I make\\n     Must be my heir: and this makes men observe me:\\n     This draws new clients daily, to my house,\\n     Women and men of every sex and age,\\n     That bring me presents, send me plate, coin, jewels,\\n     With hope that when I die (which they expect\\n     Each greedy minute) it shall then return\\n     Ten-fold upon them; whilst some, covetous\\n     Above the rest, seek to engross me whole,\\n     And counter-work the one unto the other,\\n     Contend in gifts, as they would seem in love:\\n     All which I suffer, playing with their hopes,\\n     And am content to coin them into profit,\\n     To look upon their kindness, and take more,\\n     And look on that; still bearing them in hand,\\n     Letting the cherry knock against their lips,\\n     And draw it by their mouths, and back again.--\\n     How now! [RE-ENTER MOSCA WITH NANO, ANDROGYNO, AND CASTRONE.] NAN: Now, room for fresh gamesters, who do will you to know,\\n     They do bring you neither play, nor university show;\\n     And therefore do entreat you, that whatsoever they rehearse,\\n     May not fare a whit the worse, for the false pace of the verse. If you wonder at this, you will wonder more ere we pass,\\n     For know, here is inclosed the soul of Pythagoras,\\n     That juggler divine, as hereafter shall follow;\\n     Which soul, fast and loose, sir, came first from Apollo,\\n     And was breath\\'d into Aethalides; Mercurius his son,\\n     Where it had the gift to remember all that ever was done. From thence it fled forth, and made quick transmigration\\n     To goldy-lock\\'d Euphorbus, who was killed in good fashion,\\n     At the siege of old Troy, by the cuckold of Sparta. Hermotimus was next (I find it in my charta)\\n     To whom it did pass, where no sooner it was missing\\n     But with one Pyrrhus of Delos it learn\\'d to go a fishing;\\n     And thence did it enter the sophist of Greece. From Pythagore, she went into a beautiful piece,\\n     Hight Aspasia, the meretrix; and the next toss of her\\n     Was again of a whore, she became a philosopher,\\n     Crates the cynick, as it self doth relate it:\\n     Since kings, knights, and beggars, knaves, lords and fools gat it,\\n     Besides, ox and ass, camel, mule, goat, and brock,\\n     In all which it hath spoke, as in the cobler\\'s cock. But I come not here to discourse of that matter,\\n     Or his one, two, or three, or his greath oath, BY QUATER! His musics, his trigon, his golden thigh,\\n     Or his telling how elements shift, but I\\n     Would ask, how of late thou best suffered translation,\\n     And shifted thy coat in these days of reformation. AND: Like one of the reformed, a fool, as you see,\\n     Counting all old doctrine heresy. NAN: But not on thine own forbid meats hast thou ventured? AND: On fish, when first a Carthusian I enter\\'d. NAN: Why, then thy dogmatical silence hath left thee? AND: Of that an obstreperous lawyer bereft me. NAN: O wonderful change, when sir lawyer forsook thee! For Pythagore\\'s sake, what body then took thee? AND: A good dull mule. NAN: And how! by that means\\n     Thou wert brought to allow of the eating of beans? AND: Yes. NAN: But from the mule into whom didst thou pass? AND: Into a very strange beast, by some writers call\\'d an ass;\\n     By others, a precise, pure, illuminate brother,\\n     Of those devour flesh, and sometimes one another;\\n     And will drop you forth a libel, or a sanctified lie,\\n     Betwixt every spoonful of a nativity pie. NAN: Now quit thee, for heaven, of that profane nation;\\n     And gently report thy next transmigration. AND: To the same that I am. NAN: A creature of delight,\\n     And, what is more than a fool, an hermaphrodite! Now, prithee, sweet soul, in all thy variation,\\n     Which body would\\'st thou choose, to keep up thy station? AND: Troth, this I am in: even here would I tarry. NAN: \\'Cause here the delight of each sex thou canst vary? AND: Alas, those pleasures be stale and forsaken;\\n     No, \\'tis your fool wherewith I am so taken,\\n     The only one creature that I can call blessed:\\n     For all other forms I have proved most distressed. NAN: Spoke true, as thou wert in Pythagoras still. This learned opinion we celebrate will,\\n     Fellow eunuch, as behoves us, with all our wit and art,\\n     To dignify that whereof ourselves are so great and special a part. VOLP: Now, very, very pretty! Mosca, this\\n     Was thy invention? MOS: If it please my patron,\\n     Not else. VOLP: It doth, good Mosca. MOS: Then it was, sir. NANO AND CASTRONE [SING. ]: Fools, they are the only nation\\n     Worth men\\'s envy, or admiration:\\n     Free from care or sorrow-taking,\\n     Selves and others merry making:\\n     All they speak or do is sterling. Your fool he is your great man\\'s darling,\\n     And your ladies\\' sport and pleasure;\\n     Tongue and bauble are his treasure. E\\'en his face begetteth laughter,\\n     And he speaks truth free from slaughter;\\n     He\\'s the grace of every feast,\\n     And sometimes the chiefest guest;\\n     Hath his trencher and his stool,\\n     When wit waits upon the fool:\\n     O, who would not be\\n     He, he, he? [KNOCKING WITHOUT.] VOLP: Who\\'s that? Away! [EXEUNT NANO AND CASTRONE.] Look, Mosca. Fool, begone! [EXIT ANDROGYNO.] MOS: \\'Tis Signior Voltore, the advocate;\\n     I know him by his knock. VOLP: Fetch me my gown,\\n     My furs and night-caps; say, my couch is changing,\\n     And let him entertain himself awhile\\n     Without i\\' the gallery. [EXIT MOSCA.] Now, now, my clients\\n     Begin their visitation! Vulture, kite,\\n     Raven, and gorcrow, all my birds of prey,\\n     That think me turning carcase, now they come;\\n     I am not for them yet--\\n     [RE-ENTER MOSCA, WITH THE GOWN, ETC.] How now! the news? MOS: A piece of plate, sir. VOLP: Of what bigness? MOS: Huge,\\n     Massy, and antique, with your name inscribed,\\n     And arms engraven. VOLP: Good! and not a fox\\n     Stretch\\'d on the earth, with fine delusive sleights,\\n     Mocking a gaping crow? ha, Mosca? MOS: Sharp, sir. VOLP: Give me my furs. [PUTS ON HIS SICK DRESS.] Why dost thou laugh so, man? MOS: I cannot choose, sir, when I apprehend\\n     What thoughts he has without now, as he walks:\\n     That this might be the last gift he should give;\\n     That this would fetch you; if you died to-day,\\n     And gave him all, what he should be to-morrow;\\n     What large return would come of all his ventures;\\n     How he should worship\\'d be, and reverenced;\\n     Ride with his furs, and foot-cloths; waited on\\n     By herds of fools, and clients; have clear way\\n     Made for his mule, as letter\\'d as himself;\\n     Be call\\'d the great and learned advocate:\\n     And then concludes, there\\'s nought impossible. VOLP: Yes, to be learned, Mosca. MOS: O no: rich\\n     Implies it. Hood an ass with reverend purple,\\n     So you can hide his two ambitious ears,\\n     And he shall pass for a cathedral doctor. VOLP: My caps, my caps, good Mosca. Fetch him in. MOS: Stay, sir, your ointment for your eyes. VOLP: That\\'s true;\\n     Dispatch, dispatch: I long to have possession\\n     Of my new present. MOS: That, and thousands more,\\n     I hope, to see you lord of. VOLP: Thanks, kind Mosca. MOS: And that, when I am lost in blended dust,\\n     And hundred such as I am, in succession--\\n\\n     VOLP: Nay, that were too much, Mosca. MOS: You shall live,\\n     Still, to delude these harpies. VOLP: Loving Mosca! \\'Tis well: my pillow now, and let him enter. [EXIT MOSCA.] Now, my fain\\'d cough, my pthisic, and my gout,\\n     My apoplexy, palsy, and catarrhs,\\n     Help, with your forced functions, this my posture,\\n     Wherein, this three year, I have milk\\'d their hopes. He comes; I hear him--Uh! [COUGHING.] uh! uh! uh! O--\\n\\n     [RE-ENTER MOSCA, INTRODUCING VOLTORE, WITH A PIECE OF PLATE.] MOS: You still are what you were, sir. Only you,\\n     Of all the rest, are he commands his love,\\n     And you do wisely to preserve it thus,\\n     With early visitation, and kind notes\\n     Of your good meaning to him, which, I know,\\n     Cannot but come most grateful. Patron! sir! Here\\'s signior Voltore is come--\\n\\n     VOLP [FAINTLY. ]: What say you? MOS: Sir, signior Voltore is come this morning\\n     To visit you. VOLP: I thank him. MOS: And hath brought\\n     A piece of antique plate, bought of St Mark,\\n     With which he here presents you. VOLP: He is welcome. Pray him to come more often. MOS: Yes. VOLT: What says he? MOS: He thanks you, and desires you see him often. VOLP: Mosca. MOS: My patron! VOLP: Bring him near, where is he? I long to feel his hand. MOS: The plate is here, sir. VOLT: How fare you, sir? VOLP: I thank you, signior Voltore;\\n     Where is the plate? mine eyes are bad. VOLT [PUTTING IT INTO HIS HANDS. ]: I\\'m sorry,\\n     To see you still thus weak. MOS [ASIDE. ]: That he\\'s not weaker. VOLP: You are too munificent. VOLT: No sir; would to heaven,\\n     I could as well give health to you, as that plate! VOLP: You give, sir, what you can: I thank you. Your love\\n     Hath taste in this, and shall not be unanswer\\'d:\\n     I pray you see me often. VOLT: Yes, I shall sir. VOLP: Be not far from me. MOS: Do you observe that, sir? VOLP: Hearken unto me still; it will concern you. MOS: You are a happy man, sir; know your good. VOLP: I cannot now last long--\\n\\n     MOS: You are his heir, sir. VOLT: Am I? VOLP: I feel me going; Uh! uh! uh! uh! I\\'m sailing to my port, Uh! uh! uh! uh! And I am glad I am so near my haven. MOS: Alas, kind gentleman! Well, we must all go--\\n\\n     VOLT: But, Mosca--\\n\\n     MOS: Age will conquer. VOLT: \\'Pray thee hear me:\\n     Am I inscribed his heir for certain? MOS: Are you! I do beseech you, sir, you will vouchsafe\\n     To write me in your family. All my hopes\\n     Depend upon your worship: I am lost,\\n     Except the rising sun do shine on me. VOLT: It shall both shine, and warm thee, Mosca. MOS: Sir,\\n     I am a man, that hath not done your love\\n     All the worst offices: here I wear your keys,\\n     See all your coffers and your caskets lock\\'d,\\n     Keep the poor inventory of your jewels,\\n     Your plate and monies; am your steward, sir. Husband your goods here. VOLT: But am I sole heir? MOS: Without a partner, sir; confirm\\'d this morning:\\n     The wax is warm yet, and the ink scarce dry\\n     Upon the parchment. VOLT: Happy, happy, me! By what good chance, sweet Mosca? MOS: Your desert, sir;\\n     I know no second cause. VOLT: Thy modesty\\n     Is not to know it; well, we shall requite it. MOS: He ever liked your course sir; that first took him. I oft have heard him say, how he admired\\n     Men of your large profession, that could speak\\n     To every cause, and things mere contraries,\\n     Till they were hoarse again, yet all be law;\\n     That, with most quick agility, could turn,\\n     And [re-] return; [could] make knots, and undo them;\\n     Give forked counsel; take provoking gold\\n     On either hand, and put it up: these men,\\n     He knew, would thrive with their humility. And, for his part, he thought he should be blest\\n     To have his heir of such a suffering spirit,\\n     So wise, so grave, of so perplex\\'d a tongue,\\n     And loud withal, that would not wag, nor scarce\\n     Lie still, without a fee; when every word\\n     Your worship but lets fall, is a chequin!--\\n     [LOUD KNOCKING WITHOUT.] Who\\'s that? one knocks; I would not have you seen, sir. And yet--pretend you came, and went in haste:\\n     I\\'ll fashion an excuse.--and, gentle sir,\\n     When you do come to swim in golden lard,\\n     Up to the arms in honey, that your chin\\n     Is born up stiff, with fatness of the flood,\\n     Think on your vassal; but remember me:\\n     I have not been your worst of clients. VOLT: Mosca!--\\n\\n     MOS: When will you have your inventory brought, sir? Or see a coppy of the will?--Anon!--\\n     I will bring them to you, sir. Away, be gone,\\n     Put business in your face. [EXIT VOLTORE.] VOLP [SPRINGING UP. ]: Excellent Mosca! Come hither, let me kiss thee. MOS: Keep you still, sir. Here is Corbaccio. VOLP: Set the plate away:\\n     The vulture\\'s gone, and the old raven\\'s come! MOS: Betake you to your silence, and your sleep:\\n     Stand there and multiply. [PUTTING THE PLATE TO THE REST.] Now, shall we see\\n     A wretch who is indeed more impotent\\n     Than this can feign to be; yet hopes to hop\\n     Over his grave.--\\n     [ENTER CORBACCIO.] Signior Corbaccio! You\\'re very welcome, sir. CORB: How does your patron? MOS: Troth, as he did, sir; no amends. CORB: What! mends he? MOS: No, sir: he\\'s rather worse. CORB: That\\'s well. Where is he? MOS: Upon his couch sir, newly fall\\'n asleep. CORB: Does he sleep well? MOS: No wink, sir, all this night. Nor yesterday; but slumbers. CORB: Good! he should take\\n     Some counsel of physicians: I have brought him\\n     An opiate here, from mine own doctor. MOS: He will not hear of drugs. CORB: Why? I myself\\n     Stood by while it was made; saw all the ingredients:\\n     And know, it cannot but most gently work:\\n     My life for his, \\'tis but to make him sleep. VOLP [ASIDE. ]: Ay, his last sleep, if he would take it. MOS: Sir,\\n     He has no faith in physic. CORB: \\'Say you? \\'say you? MOS: He has no faith in physic: he does think\\n     Most of your doctors are the greater danger,\\n     And worse disease, to escape. I often have\\n     Heard him protest, that your physician\\n     Should never be his heir. CORB: Not I his heir? MOS: Not your physician, sir. CORB: O, no, no, no,\\n     I do not mean it. MOS: No, sir, nor their fees\\n     He cannot brook: he says, they flay a man,\\n     Before they kill him. CORB: Right, I do conceive you. MOS: And then they do it by experiment;\\n     For which the law not only doth absolve them,\\n     But gives them great reward: and he is loth\\n     To hire his death, so. CORB: It is true, they kill,\\n     With as much license as a judge. MOS: Nay, more;\\n     For he but kills, sir, where the law condemns,\\n     And these can kill him too. CORB: Ay, or me;\\n     Or any man. How does his apoplex? Is that strong on him still? MOS: Most violent. His speech is broken, and his eyes are set,\\n     His face drawn longer than \\'twas wont--\\n\\n     CORB: How! how! Stronger then he was wont? MOS: No, sir: his face\\n     Drawn longer than \\'twas wont. CORB: O, good! MOS: His mouth\\n     Is ever gaping, and his eyelids hang. CORB: Good. MOS: A freezing numbness stiffens all his joints,\\n     And makes the colour of his flesh like lead. CORB: \\'Tis good. MOS: His pulse beats slow, and dull. CORB: Good symptoms, still. MOS: And from his brain--\\n\\n     CORB: I conceive you; good. MOS: Flows a cold sweat, with a continual rheum,\\n     Forth the resolved corners of his eyes. CORB: Is\\'t possible? yet I am better, ha! How does he, with the swimming of his head? B: O, sir, \\'tis past the scotomy; he now\\n     Hath lost his feeling, and hath left to snort:\\n     You hardly can perceive him, that he breathes. CORB: Excellent, excellent! sure I shall outlast him:\\n     This makes me young again, a score of years. MOS: I was a coming for you, sir. CORB: Has he made his will? What has he given me? MOS: No, sir. CORB: Nothing! ha? MOS: He has not made his will, sir. CORB: Oh, oh, oh! But what did Voltore, the Lawyer, here? MOS: He smelt a carcase, sir, when he but heard\\n     My master was about his testament;\\n     As I did urge him to it for your good--\\n\\n     CORB: He came unto him, did he? I thought so. MOS: Yes, and presented him this piece of plate. CORB: To be his heir? MOS: I do not know, sir. CORB: True:\\n     I know it too. MOS [ASIDE. ]: By your own scale, sir. CORB: Well,\\n     I shall prevent him, yet. See, Mosca, look,\\n     Here, I have brought a bag of bright chequines,\\n     Will quite weigh down his plate. MOS [TAKING THE BAG. ]: Yea, marry, sir. This is true physic, this your sacred medicine,\\n     No talk of opiates, to this great elixir! CORB: \\'Tis aurum palpabile, if not potabile. MOS: It shall be minister\\'d to him, in his bowl. CORB: Ay, do, do, do. MOS: Most blessed cordial! This will recover him. CORB: Yes, do, do, do. MOS: I think it were not best, sir. CORB: What? MOS: To recover him. CORB: O, no, no, no; by no means. MOS: Why, sir, this\\n     Will work some strange effect, if he but feel it. CORB: \\'Tis true, therefore forbear; I\\'ll take my venture:\\n     Give me it again. MOS: At no hand; pardon me:\\n     You shall not do yourself that wrong, sir. I\\n     Will so advise you, you shall have it all. CORB: How? MOS: All, sir; \\'tis your right, your own; no man\\n     Can claim a part: \\'tis yours, without a rival,\\n     Decreed by destiny. CORB: How, how, good Mosca? MOS: I\\'ll tell you sir. This fit he shall recover. CORB: I do conceive you. MOS: And, on first advantage\\n     Of his gain\\'d sense, will I re-importune him\\n     Unto the making of his testament:\\n     And shew him this. [POINTING TO THE MONEY.] CORB: Good, good. MOS: \\'Tis better yet,\\n     If you will hear, sir. CORB: Yes, with all my heart. MOS: Now, would I counsel you, make home with speed;\\n     There, frame a will; whereto you shall inscribe\\n     My master your sole heir. CORB: And disinherit\\n     My son! MOS: O, sir, the better: for that colour\\n     Shall make it much more taking. CORB: O, but colour? MOS: This will sir, you shall send it unto me. Now, when I come to inforce, as I will do,\\n     Your cares, your watchings, and your many prayers,\\n     Your more than many gifts, your this day\\'s present,\\n     And last, produce your will; where, without thought,\\n     Or least regard, unto your proper issue,\\n     A son so brave, and highly meriting,\\n     The stream of your diverted love hath thrown you\\n     Upon my master, and made him your heir:\\n     He cannot be so stupid, or stone-dead,\\n     But out of conscience, and mere gratitude--\\n\\n     CORB: He must pronounce me his? MOS: \\'Tis true. CORB: This plot\\n     Did I think on before. MOS: I do believe it. CORB: Do you not believe it? MOS: Yes, sir. CORB: Mine own project. MOS: Which, when he hath done, sir. CORB: Publish\\'d me his heir? MOS: And you so certain to survive him--\\n\\n     CORB: Ay. MOS: Being so lusty a man--\\n\\n     CORB: \\'Tis true. MOS: Yes, sir--\\n\\n     CORB: I thought on that too. See, how he should be\\n     The very organ to express my thoughts! MOS: You have not only done yourself a good--\\n\\n     CORB: But multiplied it on my son. MOS: \\'Tis right, sir. CORB: Still, my invention. MOS: \\'Las, sir! heaven knows,\\n     It hath been all my study, all my care,\\n     (I e\\'en grow gray withal,) how to work things--\\n\\n     CORB: I do conceive, sweet Mosca. MOS: You are he,\\n     For whom I labour here. CORB: Ay, do, do, do:\\n     I\\'ll straight about it. [GOING.] MOS: Rook go with you, raven! CORB: I know thee honest. MOS [ASIDE. ]: You do lie, sir! CORB: And--\\n\\n     MOS: Your knowledge is no better than your ears, sir. CORB: I do not doubt, to be a father to thee. MOS: Nor I to gull my brother of his blessing. CORB: I may have my youth restored to me, why not? MOS: Your worship is a precious ass! CORB: What say\\'st thou? MOS: I do desire your worship to make haste, sir. CORB: \\'Tis done, \\'tis done, I go. [EXIT.] VOLP [LEAPING FROM HIS COUCH. ]: O, I shall burst! Let out my sides, let out my sides--\\n\\n     MOS: Contain\\n     Your flux of laughter, sir: you know this hope\\n     Is such a bait, it covers any hook. VOLP: O, but thy working, and thy placing it! I cannot hold; good rascal, let me kiss thee:\\n     I never knew thee in so rare a humour. MOS: Alas sir, I but do as I am taught;\\n     Follow your grave instructions; give them words;\\n     Pour oil into their ears, and send them hence. VOLP: \\'Tis true, \\'tis true. What a rare punishment\\n     Is avarice to itself! MOS: Ay, with our help, sir. VOLP: So many cares, so many maladies,\\n     So many fears attending on old age,\\n     Yea, death so often call\\'d on, as no wish\\n     Can be more frequent with them, their limbs faint,\\n     Their senses dull, their seeing, hearing, going,\\n     All dead before them; yea, their very teeth,\\n     Their instruments of eating, failing them:\\n     Yet this is reckon\\'d life! nay, here was one;\\n     Is now gone home, that wishes to live longer! Feels not his gout, nor palsy; feigns himself\\n     Younger by scores of years, flatters his age\\n     With confident belying it, hopes he may,\\n     With charms, like Aeson, have his youth restored:\\n     And with these thoughts so battens, as if fate\\n     Would be as easily cheated on, as he,\\n     And all turns air! [KNOCKING WITHIN.] Who\\'s that there, now? a third? MOS: Close, to your couch again; I hear his voice:\\n     It is Corvino, our spruce merchant. VOLP [LIES DOWN AS BEFORE. ]: Dead. MOS: Another bout, sir, with your eyes. [ANOINTING THEM.] --Who\\'s there? [ENTER CORVINO.] Signior Corvino! come most wish\\'d for! O,\\n     How happy were you, if you knew it, now! CORV: Why? what? wherein? MOS: The tardy hour is come, sir. CORV: He is not dead? MOS: Not dead, sir, but as good;\\n     He knows no man. CORV: How shall I do then? MOS: Why, sir? CORV: I have brought him here a pearl. MOS: Perhaps he has\\n     So much remembrance left, as to know you, sir:\\n     He still calls on you; nothing but your name\\n     Is in his mouth: Is your pearl orient, sir? CORV: Venice was never owner of the like. VOLP [FAINTLY. ]: Signior Corvino. MOS: Hark. VOLP: Signior Corvino! MOS: He calls you; step and give it him.--He\\'s here, sir,\\n     And he has brought you a rich pearl. CORV: How do you, sir? Tell him, it doubles the twelfth caract. MOS: Sir,\\n     He cannot understand, his hearing\\'s gone;\\n     And yet it comforts him to see you--\\n\\n     CORV: Say,\\n     I have a diamond for him, too. MOS: Best shew it, sir;\\n     Put it into his hand; \\'tis only there\\n     He apprehends: he has his feeling, yet. See how he grasps it! CORV: \\'Las, good gentleman! How pitiful the sight is! MOS: Tut! forget, sir. The weeping of an heir should still be laughter\\n     Under a visor. CORV: Why, am I his heir? MOS: Sir, I am sworn, I may not shew the will,\\n     Till he be dead; but, here has been Corbaccio,\\n     Here has been Voltore, here were others too,\\n     I cannot number \\'em, they were so many;\\n     All gaping here for legacies: but I,\\n     Taking the vantage of his naming you,\\n     \"Signior Corvino, Signior Corvino,\" took\\n     Paper, and pen, and ink, and there I asked him,\\n     Whom he would have his heir? \"Corvino.\" Who\\n     Should be executor? \"Corvino.\" And,\\n     To any question he was silent too,\\n     I still interpreted the nods he made,\\n     Through weakness, for consent: and sent home th\\' others,\\n     Nothing bequeath\\'d them, but to cry and curse. CORV: O, my dear Mosca! [THEY EMBRACE.] Does he not perceive us? MOS: No more than a blind harper. He knows no man,\\n     No face of friend, nor name of any servant,\\n     Who \\'twas that fed him last, or gave him drink:\\n     Not those he hath begotten, or brought up,\\n     Can he remember. CORV: Has he children? MOS: Bastards,\\n     Some dozen, or more, that he begot on beggars,\\n     Gipsies, and Jews, and black-moors, when he was drunk. Knew you not that, sir? \\'tis the common fable. The dwarf, the fool, the eunuch, are all his;\\n     He\\'s the true father of his family,\\n     In all, save me:--but he has giv\\'n them nothing. CORV: That\\'s well, that\\'s well. Art sure he does not hear us? MOS: Sure, sir! why, look you, credit your own sense. [SHOUTS IN VOL. \\'S EAR.] The pox approach, and add to your diseases,\\n     If it would send you hence the sooner, sir,\\n     For your incontinence, it hath deserv\\'d it\\n     Thoroughly, and thoroughly, and the plague to boot!--\\n     You may come near, sir.--Would you would once close\\n     Those filthy eyes of yours, that flow with slime,\\n     Like two frog-pits; and those same hanging cheeks,\\n     Cover\\'d with hide, instead of skin--Nay help, sir--\\n     That look like frozen dish-clouts, set on end! CORV [ALOUD. ]: Or like an old smoked wall, on which the rain\\n     Ran down in streaks! MOS: Excellent! sir, speak out:\\n     You may be louder yet: A culverin\\n     Discharged in his ear would hardly bore it. CORV: His nose is like a common sewer, still running. MOS: \\'Tis good! And what his mouth? CORV: A very draught. MOS: O, stop it up--\\n\\n     CORV: By no means. MOS: \\'Pray you, let me. Faith I could stifle him, rarely with a pillow,\\n     As well as any woman that should keep him. CORV: Do as you will: but I\\'ll begone. MOS: Be so:\\n     It is your presence makes him last so long. CORV: I pray you, use no violence. MOS: No, sir! why? Why should you be thus scrupulous, pray you, sir? CORV: Nay, at your discretion. MOS: Well, good sir, begone. CORV: I will not trouble him now, to take my pearl. MOS: Puh! nor your diamond. What a needless care\\n     Is this afflicts you? Is not all here yours? Am not I here, whom you have made your creature? That owe my being to you? CORV: Grateful Mosca! Thou art my friend, my fellow, my companion,\\n     My partner, and shalt share in all my fortunes. MOS: Excepting one. CORV: What\\'s that? MOS: Your gallant wife, sir,--\\n     [EXIT CORV.] Now is he gone: we had no other means\\n     To shoot him hence, but this. VOLP: My divine Mosca! Thou hast to-day outgone thyself. [KNOCKING WITHIN.] --Who\\'s there? I will be troubled with no more. Prepare\\n     Me music, dances, banquets, all delights;\\n     The Turk is not more sensual in his pleasures,\\n     Than will Volpone. [EXIT MOS.] Let me see; a pearl! A diamond! plate! chequines! Good morning\\'s purchase,\\n     Why, this is better than rob churches, yet;\\n     Or fat, by eating, once a month, a man. [RE-ENTER MOSCA.] Who is\\'t? MOS: The beauteous lady Would-be, sir. Wife to the English knight, Sir Politick Would-be,\\n     (This is the style, sir, is directed me,)\\n     Hath sent to know how you have slept to-night,\\n     And if you would be visited? VOLP: Not now:\\n     Some three hours hence--\\n\\n     MOS: I told the squire so much. VOLP: When I am high with mirth and wine; then, then:\\n     \\'Fore heaven, I wonder at the desperate valour\\n     Of the bold English, that they dare let loose\\n     Their wives to all encounters! MOS: Sir, this knight\\n     Had not his name for nothing, he is politick,\\n     And knows, howe\\'er his wife affect strange airs,\\n     She hath not yet the face to be dishonest:\\n     But had she signior Corvino\\'s wife\\'s face--\\n\\n     VOLP: Has she so rare a face? MOS: O, sir, the wonder,\\n     The blazing star of Italy! a wench\\n     Of the first year! a beauty ripe as harvest! Whose skin is whiter than a swan all over,\\n     Than silver, snow, or lilies! a soft lip,\\n     Would tempt you to eternity of kissing! And flesh that melteth in the touch to blood! Bright as your gold, and lovely as your gold! VOLP: Why had not I known this before? MOS: Alas, sir,\\n     Myself but yesterday discover\\'d it. VOLP: How might I see her? MOS: O, not possible;\\n     She\\'s kept as warily as is your gold;\\n     Never does come abroad, never takes air,\\n     But at a window. All her looks are sweet,\\n     As the first grapes or cherries, and are watch\\'d\\n     As near as they are. VOLP: I must see her. MOS: Sir,\\n     There is a guard of spies ten thick upon her,\\n     All his whole household; each of which is set\\n     Upon his fellow, and have all their charge,\\n     When he goes out, when he comes in, examined. VOLP: I will go see her, though but at her window. MOS: In some disguise, then. VOLP: That is true; I must\\n     Maintain mine own shape still the same: we\\'ll think. [EXEUNT.] ACT 2. SCENE 2.1. ST. MARK\\'S PLACE; A RETIRED CORNER BEFORE CORVINO\\'S HOUSE. ENTER SIR POLITICK WOULD-BE, AND PEREGRINE. SIR P: Sir, to a wise man, all the world\\'s his soil:\\n     It is not Italy, nor France, nor Europe,\\n     That must bound me, if my fates call me forth. Yet, I protest, it is no salt desire\\n     Of seeing countries, shifting a religion,\\n     Nor any disaffection to the state\\n     Where I was bred, and unto which I owe\\n     My dearest plots, hath brought me out; much less,\\n     That idle, antique, stale, gray-headed project\\n     Of knowing men\\'s minds, and manners, with Ulysses! But a peculiar humour of my wife\\'s\\n     Laid for this height of Venice, to observe,\\n     To quote, to learn the language, and so forth--\\n     I hope you travel, sir, with license? PER: Yes. SIR P: I dare the safelier converse--How long, sir,\\n     Since you left England? PER: Seven weeks. SIR P: So lately! You have not been with my lord ambassador? PER: Not yet, sir. SIR P: Pray you, what news, sir, vents our climate? I heard last night a most strange thing reported\\n     By some of my lord\\'s followers, and I long\\n     To hear how \\'twill be seconded. PER: What was\\'t, sir? SIR P: Marry, sir, of a raven that should build\\n     In a ship royal of the king\\'s. PER [ASIDE. ]: This fellow,\\n     Does he gull me, trow? or is gull\\'d? --Your name, sir. SIR P: My name is Politick Would-be. PER [ASIDE. ]: O, that speaks him. --A knight, sir? SIR P: A poor knight, sir. PER: Your lady\\n     Lies here in Venice, for intelligence\\n     Of tires, and fashions, and behaviour,\\n     Among the courtezans? the fine lady Would-be? SIR P: Yes, sir; the spider and the bee, ofttimes,\\n     Suck from one flower. PER: Good Sir Politick,\\n     I cry you mercy; I have heard much of you:\\n     \\'Tis true, sir, of your raven. SIR P: On your knowledge? PER: Yes, and your lion\\'s whelping, in the Tower. SIR P: Another whelp! PER: Another, sir. SIR P: Now heaven! What prodigies be these? The fires at Berwick! And the new star! these things concurring, strange,\\n     And full of omen! Saw you those meteors? PER: I did, sir. SIR P: Fearful! Pray you, sir, confirm me,\\n     Were there three porpoises seen above the bridge,\\n     As they give out? PER: Six, and a sturgeon, sir. SIR P: I am astonish\\'d. PER: Nay, sir, be not so;\\n     I\\'ll tell you a greater prodigy than these. SIR P: What should these things portend? PER: The very day\\n     (Let me be sure) that I put forth from London,\\n     There was a whale discover\\'d in the river,\\n     As high as Woolwich, that had waited there,\\n     Few know how many months, for the subversion\\n     Of the Stode fleet. SIR P: Is\\'t possible? believe it,\\n     \\'Twas either sent from Spain, or the archdukes:\\n     Spinola\\'s whale, upon my life, my credit! Will they not leave these projects? Worthy sir,\\n     Some other news. PER: Faith, Stone the fool is dead;\\n     And they do lack a tavern fool extremely. SIR P: Is Mass Stone dead? PER: He\\'s dead sir; why, I hope\\n     You thought him not immortal? [ASIDE.] --O, this knight,\\n     Were he well known, would be a precious thing\\n     To fit our English stage: he that should write\\n     But such a fellow, should be thought to feign\\n     Extremely, if not maliciously. SIR P: Stone dead! PER: Dead.--Lord! how deeply sir, you apprehend it? He was no kinsman to you? SIR P: That I know of. Well! that same fellow was an unknown fool. PER: And yet you knew him, it seems? SIR P: I did so. Sir,\\n     I knew him one of the most dangerous heads\\n     Living within the state, and so I held him. PER: Indeed, sir? SIR P: While he lived, in action. He has received weekly intelligence,\\n     Upon my knowledge, out of the Low Countries,\\n     For all parts of the world, in cabbages;\\n     And those dispensed again to ambassadors,\\n     In oranges, musk-melons, apricocks,\\n     Lemons, pome-citrons, and such-like: sometimes\\n     In Colchester oysters, and your Selsey cockles. PER: You make me wonder. SIR P: Sir, upon my knowledge. Nay, I\\'ve observed him, at your public ordinary,\\n     Take his advertisement from a traveller\\n     A conceal\\'d statesman, in a trencher of meat;\\n     And instantly, before the meal was done,\\n     Convey an answer in a tooth-pick. PER: Strange! How could this be, sir? SIR P: Why, the meat was cut\\n     So like his character, and so laid, as he\\n     Must easily read the cipher. PER: I have heard,\\n     He could not read, sir. SIR P: So \\'twas given out,\\n     In policy, by those that did employ him:\\n     But he could read, and had your languages,\\n     And to\\'t, as sound a noddle--\\n\\n     PER: I have heard, sir,\\n     That your baboons were spies, and that they were\\n     A kind of subtle nation near to China:\\n\\n     SIR P: Ay, ay, your Mamuluchi. Faith, they had\\n     Their hand in a French plot or two; but they\\n     Were so extremely given to women, as\\n     They made discovery of all: yet I\\n     Had my advices here, on Wednesday last. From one of their own coat, they were return\\'d,\\n     Made their relations, as the fashion is,\\n     And now stand fair for fresh employment. PER: \\'Heart! [ASIDE.] This sir Pol will be ignorant of nothing. --It seems, sir, you know all? SIR P: Not all sir, but\\n     I have some general notions. I do love\\n     To note and to observe: though I live out,\\n     Free from the active torrent, yet I\\'d mark\\n     The currents and the passages of things,\\n     For mine own private use; and know the ebbs,\\n     And flows of state. PER: Believe it, sir, I hold\\n     Myself in no small tie unto my fortunes,\\n     For casting me thus luckily upon you,\\n     Whose knowledge, if your bounty equal it,\\n     May do me great assistance, in instruction\\n     For my behaviour, and my bearing, which\\n     Is yet so rude and raw. SIR P: Why, came you forth\\n     Empty of rules, for travel? PER: Faith, I had\\n     Some common ones, from out that vulgar grammar,\\n     Which he that cried Italian to me, taught me. SIR P: Why this it is, that spoils all our brave bloods,\\n     Trusting our hopeful gentry unto pedants,\\n     Fellows of outside, and mere bark. You seem\\n     To be a gentleman, of ingenuous race:--\\n     I not profess it, but my fate hath been\\n     To be, where I have been consulted with,\\n     In this high kind, touching some great men\\'s sons,\\n     Persons of blood, and honour.--\\n\\n     [ENTER MOSCA AND NANO DISGUISED, FOLLOWED BY PERSONS WITH\\n     MATERIALS FOR ERECTING A STAGE.] PER: Who be these, sir? MOS: Under that window, there \\'t must be. The same. SIR P: Fellows, to mount a bank. Did your instructor\\n     In the dear tongues, never discourse to you\\n     Of the Italian mountebanks? PER: Yes, sir. SIR P: Why,\\n     Here shall you see one. PER: They are quacksalvers;\\n     Fellows, that live by venting oils and drugs. SIR P: Was that the character he gave you of them? PER: As I remember. SIR P: Pity his ignorance. They are the only knowing men of Europe! Great general scholars, excellent physicians,\\n     Most admired statesmen, profest favourites,\\n     And cabinet counsellors to the greatest princes;\\n     The only languaged men of all the world! PER: And, I have heard, they are most lewd impostors;\\n     Made all of terms and shreds; no less beliers\\n     Of great men\\'s favours, than their own vile med\\'cines;\\n     Which they will utter upon monstrous oaths:\\n     Selling that drug for two-pence, ere they part,\\n     Which they have valued at twelve crowns before. SIR P: Sir, calumnies are answer\\'d best with silence. Yourself shall judge.--Who is it mounts, my friends? MOS: Scoto of Mantua, sir. SIR P: Is\\'t he? Nay, then\\n     I\\'ll proudly promise, sir, you shall behold\\n     Another man than has been phant\\'sied to you. I wonder yet, that he should mount his bank,\\n     Here in this nook, that has been wont t\\'appear\\n     In face of the Piazza!--Here, he comes. [ENTER VOLPONE, DISGUISED AS A MOUNTEBANK DOCTOR, AND\\n     FOLLOWED BY A CROWD OF PEOPLE.] VOLP [TO NANO. ]: Mount zany. MOB: Follow, follow, follow, follow! SIR P: See how the people follow him! he\\'s a man\\n     May write ten thousand crowns in bank here. Note,\\n     [VOLPONE MOUNTS THE STAGE.] Mark but his gesture:--I do use to observe\\n     The state he keeps in getting up. PER: \\'Tis worth it, sir. VOLP: Most noble gentlemen, and my worthy patrons! It may seem\\n     strange, that I, your Scoto Mantuano, who was ever wont to fix\\n     my bank in face of the public Piazza, near the shelter of the\\n     Portico to the Procuratia, should now, after eight months\\'\\n     absence from this illustrious city of Venice, humbly retire\\n     myself into an obscure nook of the Piazza. SIR P: Did not I now object the same? PER: Peace, sir. VOLP: Let me tell you: I am not, as your Lombard proverb saith,\\n     cold on my feet; or content to part with my commodities at a\\n     cheaper rate, than I accustomed: look not for it. Nor that the\\n     calumnious reports of that impudent detractor, and shame to our\\n     profession, (Alessandro Buttone, I mean,) who gave out, in\\n     public, I was condemn\\'d a sforzato to the galleys, for\\n     poisoning the cardinal Bembo\\'s--cook, hath at all attached,\\n     much less dejected me. No, no, worthy gentlemen; to tell you\\n     true, I cannot endure to see the rabble of these ground\\n     ciarlitani, that spread their cloaks on the pavement, as if\\n     they meant to do feats of activity, and then come in lamely,\\n     with their mouldy tales out of Boccacio, like stale Tabarine,\\n     the fabulist: some of them discoursing their travels, and of\\n     their tedious captivity in the Turks\\' galleys, when, indeed,\\n     were the truth known, they were the Christians\\' galleys, where\\n     very temperately they eat bread, and drunk water, as a\\n     wholesome penance, enjoined them by their confessors, for base\\n     pilferies. SIR P: Note but his bearing, and contempt of these. VOLP: These turdy-facy-nasty-paty-lousy-fartical rogues, with\\n     one poor groat\\'s-worth of unprepared antimony, finely wrapt up\\n     in several scartoccios, are able, very well, to kill their\\n     twenty a week, and play; yet, these meagre, starved spirits,\\n     who have half stopt the organs of their minds with earthy\\n     oppilations, want not their favourers among your shrivell\\'d\\n     sallad-eating artizans, who are overjoyed that they may have\\n     their half-pe\\'rth of physic; though it purge them into another\\n     world, it makes no matter. SIR P: Excellent! have you heard better language, sir? VOLP: Well, let them go. And, gentlemen, honourable gentlemen,\\n     know, that for this time, our bank, being thus removed from the\\n     clamours of the canaglia, shall be the scene of pleasure and\\n     delight; for I have nothing to sell, little or nothing to sell. SIR P: I told you, sir, his end. PER: You did so, sir. VOLP: I protest, I, and my six servants, are not able to make\\n     of this precious liquor, so fast as it is fetch\\'d away from my\\n     lodging by gentlemen of your city; strangers of the Terra-firma;\\n     worshipful merchants; ay, and senators too: who, ever since my\\n     arrival, have detained me to their uses, by their splendidous\\n     liberalities. And worthily; for, what avails your rich man to\\n     have his magazines stuft with moscadelli, or of the purest\\n     grape, when his physicians prescribe him, on pain of death,\\n     to drink nothing but water cocted with aniseeds? O health! health! the blessing of the rich, the riches of the poor! who\\n     can buy thee at too dear a rate, since there is no enjoying\\n     this world without thee? Be not then so sparing of your purses,\\n     honourable gentlemen, as to abridge the natural course of life--\\n\\n     PER: You see his end. SIR P: Ay, is\\'t not good? VOLP: For, when a humid flux, or catarrh, by the mutability of\\n     air, falls from your head into an arm or shoulder, or any other\\n     part; take you a ducat, or your chequin of gold, and apply to\\n     the place affected: see what good effect it can work. No, no,\\n     \\'tis this blessed unguento, this rare extraction, that hath\\n     only power to disperse all malignant humours, that proceed\\n     either of hot, cold, moist, or windy causes--\\n\\n     PER: I would he had put in dry too. SIR P: \\'Pray you, observe. VOLP: To fortify the most indigest and crude stomach, ay, were\\n     it of one, that, through extreme weakness, vomited blood,\\n     applying only a warm napkin to the place, after the unction\\n     and fricace;--for the vertigine in the head, putting but a drop\\n     into your nostrils, likewise behind the ears; a most sovereign\\n     and approved remedy. The mal caduco, cramps, convulsions,\\n     paralysies, epilepsies, tremor-cordia, retired nerves, ill\\n     vapours of the spleen, stopping of the liver, the stone, the\\n     strangury, hernia ventosa, iliaca passio; stops a disenteria\\n     immediately; easeth the torsion of the small guts: and cures\\n     melancholia hypocondriaca, being taken and applied according to\\n     my printed receipt. [POINTING TO HIS BILL AND HIS VIAL.] For, this is the physician, this the medicine; this counsels,\\n     this cures; this gives the direction, this works the effect;\\n     and, in sum, both together may be termed an abstract of the\\n     theorick and practick in the Aesculapian art. \\'Twill cost you\\n     eight crowns. And,--Zan Fritada, prithee sing a verse extempore\\n     in honour of it. SIR P: How do you like him, sir? PER: Most strangely, I! SIR P: Is not his language rare? PER: But alchemy,\\n     I never heard the like: or Broughton\\'s books. NANO [SINGS. '"

       "\"\\n     To prove his best, and, if none here gainsay it,\\n     The part he hath studied, and intends to play it. EPILOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT. In graving with Pygmalion to contend,\\n     Or painting with Apelles, doubtless the end\\n     Must be disgrace:  our actor did not so,--\\n     He only aim'd to go, but not out-go. Nor think that this day any prize was play'd; [9]\\n     Here were no bets at all, no wagers laid: [10]\\n     All the ambition that his mind doth swell,\\n     Is but to hear from you (by me) 'twas well. DRAMATIS PERSONAE. FERNEZE, governor of Malta. LODOWICK, his son. SELIM CALYMATH, son to the Grand Seignior. MARTIN DEL BOSCO, vice-admiral of Spain. MATHIAS, a gentleman. JACOMO,     |\\n     BARNARDINE, | friars. BARABAS, a wealthy Jew. ITHAMORE, a slave. PILIA-BORZA, a bully, attendant to BELLAMIRA. Two Merchants. Three Jews. Knights, Bassoes, Officers, Guard, Slaves, Messenger,\\n          and Carpenters\\n\\n     KATHARINE, mother to MATHIAS. ABIGAIL, daughter to BARABAS. BELLAMIRA, a courtezan. Abbess. Nun. MACHIAVEL as Prologue speaker. Scene, Malta. THE JEW OF MALTA. Enter MACHIAVEL. MACHIAVEL. Albeit the world think Machiavel is dead,\\n     Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps;\\n     And, now the Guise [11] is dead, is come from France,\\n     To view this land, and frolic with his friends. To some perhaps my name is odious;\\n     But such as love me, guard me from their tongues,\\n     And let them know that I am Machiavel,\\n     And weigh not men, and therefore not men's words. Admir'd I am of those that hate me most:\\n     Though some speak openly against my books,\\n     Yet will they read me, and thereby attain\\n     To Peter's chair; and, when they cast me off,\\n     Are poison'd by my climbing followers. I count religion but a childish toy,\\n     And hold there is no sin but ignorance. Birds of the air will tell of murders past! I am asham'd to hear such fooleries. Many will talk of title to a crown:\\n     What right had Caesar to the empery? [12]\\n     Might first made kings, and laws were then most sure\\n     When, like the Draco's, [13] they were writ in blood. Hence comes it that a strong-built citadel\\n     Commands much more than letters can import:\\n     Which maxim had [14] Phalaris observ'd,\\n     H'ad never bellow'd, in a brazen bull,\\n     Of great ones' envy:  o' the poor petty wights\\n     Let me be envied and not pitied. But whither am I bound? I come not, I,\\n     To read a lecture here [15] in Britain,\\n     But to present the tragedy of a Jew,\\n     Who smiles to see how full his bags are cramm'd;\\n     Which money was not got without my means. I crave but this,--grace him as he deserves,\\n     And let him not be entertain'd the worse\\n     Because he favours me. [Exit.] ACT I. [16]\\n\\n          BARABAS discovered in his counting-house, with heaps\\n          of gold before him. BARABAS. So that of thus much that return was made;\\n     And of the third part of the Persian ships\\n     There was the venture summ'd and satisfied. As for those Samnites, [17] and the men of Uz,\\n     That bought my Spanish oils and wines of Greece,\\n     Here have I purs'd their paltry silverlings. [18]\\n     Fie, what a trouble 'tis to count this trash! Well fare the Arabians, who so richly pay\\n     The things they traffic for with wedge of gold,\\n     Whereof a man may easily in a day\\n     Tell [19] that which may maintain him all his life. The needy groom, that never finger'd groat,\\n     Would make a miracle of thus much coin;\\n     But he whose steel-barr'd coffers are cramm'd full,\\n     And all his life-time hath been tired,\\n     Wearying his fingers' ends with telling it,\\n     Would in his age be loath to labour so,\\n     And for a pound to sweat himself to death. Give me the merchants of the Indian mines,\\n     That trade in metal of the purest mould;\\n     The wealthy Moor, that in the eastern rocks\\n     Without control can pick his riches up,\\n     And in his house heap pearl like pebble-stones,\\n     Receive them free, and sell them by the weight;\\n     Bags of fiery opals, sapphires, amethysts,\\n     Jacinths, hard topaz, grass-green emeralds,\\n     Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds,\\n     And seld-seen [20] costly stones of so great price,\\n     As one of them, indifferently rated,\\n     And of a carat of this quantity,\\n     May serve, in peril of calamity,\\n     To ransom great kings from captivity. This is the ware wherein consists my wealth;\\n     And thus methinks should men of judgment frame\\n     Their means of traffic from the vulgar trade,\\n     And, as their wealth increaseth, so inclose\\n     Infinite riches in a little room. But now how stands the wind? Into what corner peers my halcyon's bill? [21]\\n     Ha! to the east? yes. See how stand the vanes--\\n     East and by south:  why, then, I hope my ships\\n     I sent for Egypt and the bordering isles\\n     Are gotten up by Nilus' winding banks;\\n     Mine argosy from Alexandria,\\n     Loaden with spice and silks, now under sail,\\n     Are smoothly gliding down by Candy-shore\\n     To Malta, through our Mediterranean sea.--\\n     But who comes here? Enter a MERCHANT. How now! MERCHANT. Barabas, thy ships are safe,\\n     Riding in Malta-road; and all the merchants\\n     With other merchandise are safe arriv'd,\\n     And have sent me to know whether yourself\\n     Will come and custom them. [22]\\n\\n     BARABAS. The ships are safe thou say'st, and richly fraught? MERCHANT. They are. BARABAS. Why, then, go bid them come ashore,\\n     And bring with them their bills of entry:\\n     I hope our credit in the custom-house\\n     Will serve as well as I were present there. Go send 'em threescore camels, thirty mules,\\n     And twenty waggons, to bring up the ware. But art thou master in a ship of mine,\\n     And is thy credit not enough for that? MERCHANT. The very custom barely comes to more\\n     Than many merchants of the town are worth,\\n     And therefore far exceeds my credit, sir. BARABAS. Go tell 'em the Jew of Malta sent thee, man:\\n     Tush, who amongst 'em knows not Barabas? MERCHANT. I go. BARABAS. So, then, there's somewhat come.--\\n     Sirrah, which of my ships art thou master of? MERCHANT. Of the Speranza, sir. BARABAS. And saw'st thou not\\n     Mine argosy at Alexandria? Thou couldst not come from Egypt, or by Caire,\\n     But at the entry there into the sea,\\n     Where Nilus pays his tribute to the main,\\n     Thou needs must sail by Alexandria. MERCHANT. I neither saw them, nor inquir'd of them:\\n     But this we heard some of our seamen say,\\n     They wonder'd how you durst with so much wealth\\n     Trust such a crazed vessel, and so far. BARABAS. Tush, they are wise! I know her and her strength. But [23] go, go thou thy ways, discharge thy ship,\\n     And bid my factor bring his loading in. [Exit MERCHANT.] And yet I wonder at this argosy. Enter a Second MERCHANT. SECOND MERCHANT. Thine argosy from Alexandria,\\n     Know, Barabas, doth ride in Malta-road,\\n     Laden with riches, and exceeding store\\n     Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl. BARABAS. How chance you came not with those other ships\\n     That sail'd by Egypt? SECOND MERCHANT. Sir, we saw 'em not. BARABAS. Belike they coasted round by Candy-shore\\n     About their oils or other businesses. But 'twas ill done of you to come so far\\n     Without the aid or conduct of their ships. SECOND MERCHANT. Sir, we were wafted by a Spanish fleet,\\n     That never left us till within a league,\\n     That had the galleys of the Turk in chase. BARABAS. O, they were going up to Sicily. Well, go,\\n     And bid the merchants and my men despatch,\\n     And come ashore, and see the fraught [24] discharg'd. SECOND MERCHANT. I go. [Exit.] BARABAS. Thus trolls our fortune in by land and sea,\\n     And thus are we on every side enrich'd:\\n     These are the blessings promis'd to the Jews,\\n     And herein was old Abraham's happiness:\\n     What more may heaven do for earthly man\\n     Than thus to pour out plenty in their laps,\\n     Ripping the bowels of the earth for them,\\n     Making the sea[s] their servants, and the winds\\n     To drive their substance with successful blasts? Who hateth me but for my happiness? Or who is honour'd now but for his wealth? Rather had I, a Jew, be hated thus,\\n     Than pitied in a Christian poverty;\\n     For I can see no fruits in all their faith,\\n     But malice, falsehood, and excessive pride,\\n     Which methinks fits not their profession. Haply some hapless man hath conscience,\\n     And for his conscience lives in beggary. They say we are a scatter'd nation:\\n     I cannot tell; but we have scambled [25] up\\n     More wealth by far than those that brag of faith:\\n     There's Kirriah Jairim, the great Jew of Greece,\\n     Obed in Bairseth, Nones in Portugal,\\n     Myself in Malta, some in Italy,\\n     Many in France, and wealthy every one;\\n     Ay, wealthier far than any Christian. I must confess we come not to be kings:\\n     That's not our fault:  alas, our number's few! And crowns come either by succession,\\n     Or urg'd by force; and nothing violent,\\n     Oft have I heard tell, can be permanent. Give us a peaceful rule; make Christians kings,\\n     That thirst so much for principality. I have no charge, nor many children,\\n     But one sole daughter, whom I hold as dear\\n     As Agamemnon did his Iphigen;\\n     And all I have is hers.--But who comes here? Enter three JEWS. [26]\\n\\n     FIRST JEW. Tush, tell not me; 'twas done of policy. SECOND JEW. Come, therefore, let us go to Barabas;\\n     For he can counsel best in these affairs:\\n     And here he comes. BARABAS. Why, how now, countrymen! Why flock you thus to me in multitudes? What accident's betided to the Jews? FIRST JEW. A fleet of warlike galleys, Barabas,\\n     Are come from Turkey, and lie in our road:\\n     And they this day sit in the council-house\\n     To entertain them and their embassy. BARABAS. Why, let 'em come, so they come not to war;\\n     Or let 'em war, so we be conquerors.--\\n     Nay, let 'em combat, conquer, and kill all,\\n     So they spare me, my daughter, and my wealth. [Aside.] FIRST JEW. Were it for confirmation of a league,\\n     They would not come in warlike manner thus. SECOND JEW. I fear their coming will afflict us all. BARABAS. Fond [27] men, what dream you of their multitudes? What need they treat of peace that are in league? The Turks and those of Malta are in league:\\n     Tut, tut, there is some other matter in't. FIRST JEW. Why, Barabas, they come for peace or war. BARABAS. Haply for neither, but to pass along,\\n     Towards Venice, by the Adriatic sea,\\n     With whom they have attempted many times,\\n     But never could effect their stratagem. THIRD JEW. And very wisely said; it may be so. SECOND JEW. But there's a meeting in the senate-house,\\n     And all the Jews in Malta must be there. BARABAS. Hum,--all the Jews in Malta must be there! Ay, like enough:  why, then, let every man\\n     Provide him, and be there for fashion-sake. If any thing shall there concern our state,\\n     Assure yourselves I'll look--unto myself. [Aside.] [28]\\n\\n     FIRST JEW. I know you will.--Well, brethren, let us go. SECOND JEW. Let's take our leaves.--Farewell, good Barabas. BARABAS. [29] Farewell, Zaareth; farewell, Temainte. [Exeunt JEWS.] And, Barabas, now search this secret out;\\n     Summon thy senses, call thy wits together:\\n     These silly men mistake the matter clean. Long to the Turk did Malta contribute;\\n     Which tribute all in policy, I fear,\\n     The Turk has [30] let increase to such a sum\\n     As all the wealth of Malta cannot pay;\\n     And now by that advantage thinks, belike,\\n     To seize upon the town; ay, that he seeks. Howe'er the world go, I'll make sure for one,\\n     And seek in time to intercept the worst,\\n     Warily guarding that which I ha' got:\\n     Ego mihimet sum semper proximus: [31]\\n     Why, let 'em enter, let 'em take the town. [Exit.] [32]\\n\\n          Enter FERNEZE governor of Malta, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS;\\n          met by CALYMATH, and BASSOES of the TURK. FERNEZE. Now, bassoes, [33] what demand you at our hands? FIRST BASSO. Know, knights of Malta, that we came from Rhodes,\\n     ]From Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles\\n     That lie betwixt the Mediterranean seas. FERNEZE. What's Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles\\n     To us or Malta? what at our hands demand ye? CALYMATH. The ten years' tribute that remains unpaid. FERNEZE. Alas, my lord, the sum is over-great! I hope your highness will consider us. CALYMATH. I wish, grave governor, [34] 'twere in my power\\n     To favour you; but 'tis my father's cause,\\n     Wherein I may not, nay, I dare not dally. FERNEZE. Then give us leave, great Selim Calymath. CALYMATH. Stand all aside, [35] and let the knights determine;\\n     And send to keep our galleys under sail,\\n     For happily [36] we shall not tarry here.--\\n     Now, governor, how are you resolv'd? FERNEZE. Thus; since your hard conditions are such\\n     That you will needs have ten years' tribute past,\\n     We may have time to make collection\\n     Amongst the inhabitants of Malta for't. FIRST BASSO. That's more than is in our commission. CALYMATH. What, Callapine! a little courtesy:\\n     Let's know their time; perhaps it is not long;\\n     And 'tis more kingly to obtain by peace\\n     Than to enforce conditions by constraint.--\\n     What respite ask you, governor? FERNEZE. But a month. CALYMATH. We grant a month; but see you keep your promise. Now launch our galleys back again to sea,\\n     Where we'll attend the respite you have ta'en,\\n     And for the money send our messenger. Farewell, great governor, and brave knights of Malta. FERNEZE. And all good fortune wait on Calymath! [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.] Go one and call those Jews of Malta hither:\\n     Were they not summon'd to appear to-day? FIRST OFFICER. They were, my lord; and here they come. Enter BARABAS and three JEWS. FIRST KNIGHT. Have you determin'd what to say to them? FERNEZE. Yes; give me leave:--and, Hebrews, now come near. ]From the Emperor of Turkey is arriv'd\\n     Great Selim Calymath, his highness' son,\\n     To levy of us ten years' tribute past:\\n     Now, then, here know that it concerneth us. BARABAS. Then, good my lord, to keep your quiet still,\\n     Your lordship shall do well to let them have it. FERNEZE. Soft, Barabas! there's more 'longs to't than so. To what this ten years' tribute will amount,\\n     That we have cast, but cannot compass it\\n     By reason of the wars, that robb'd our store;\\n     And therefore are we to request your aid. BARABAS. Alas, my lord, we are no soldiers! And what's our aid against so great a prince? FIRST KNIGHT. Tut, Jew, we know thou art no soldier:\\n     Thou art a merchant and a money'd man,\\n     And 'tis thy money, Barabas, we seek. BARABAS. How, my lord! my money! FERNEZE. Thine and the rest;\\n     For, to be short, amongst you't must be had. FIRST JEW. Alas, my lord, the most of us are poor! FERNEZE. Then let the rich increase your portions. BARABAS. Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd? SECOND KNIGHT. Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth? Then let them with us contribute. BARABAS. How! equally? FERNEZE. No, Jew, like infidels;\\n     For through our sufferance of your hateful lives,\\n     Who stand accursed in the sight of heaven,\\n     These taxes and afflictions are befall'n,\\n     And therefore thus we are determined.--\\n     Read there the articles of our decrees. OFFICER. [37] [reads] FIRST, THE TRIBUTE-MONEY OF THE TURKS\\n     SHALL ALL BE LEVIED AMONGST THE JEWS, AND EACH OF THEM TO PAY\\n     ONE HALF OF HIS ESTATE. BARABAS. How! half his estate!--I hope you mean not mine. [Aside.] FERNEZE. Read on. OFFICER. [reads] SECONDLY, HE THAT DENIES [38] TO PAY, SHALL\\n     STRAIGHT-BECOME A CHRISTIAN. BARABAS. How! a Christian!--Hum,--what's here to do? [Aside.] OFFICER. [reads] LASTLY, HE THAT DENIES THIS, SHALL ABSOLUTELY\\n     LOSE ALL HE HAS. THREE JEWS. O my lord, we will give half! BARABAS. O earth-mettled villains, and no Hebrews born! And will you basely thus submit yourselves\\n     To leave your goods to their arbitrement? FERNEZE. Why, Barabas, wilt thou be christened? BARABAS. No, governor, I will be no convertite. [39]\\n\\n     FERNEZE. Then pay thy half. BARABAS. Why, know you what you did by this device? Half of my substance is a city's wealth. Governor, it was not got so easily;\\n     Nor will I part so slightly therewithal. FERNEZE. Sir, half is the penalty of our decree;\\n     Either pay that, or we will seize on all. BARABAS. Corpo di Dio! stay:  you shall have half;\\n     Let me be us'd but as my brethren are. FERNEZE. No, Jew, thou hast denied the articles,\\n     And now it cannot be recall'd. [Exeunt OFFICERS, on a sign from FERNEZE]\\n\\n     BARABAS. Will you, then, steal my goods? Is theft the ground of your religion? FERNEZE. No, Jew; we take particularly thine,\\n     To save the ruin of a multitude:\\n     And better one want for a common good,\\n     Than many perish for a private man:\\n     Yet, Barabas, we will not banish thee,\\n     But here in Malta, where thou gott'st thy wealth,\\n     Live still; and, if thou canst, get more. BARABAS. Christians, what or how can I multiply? Of naught is nothing made. FIRST KNIGHT. From naught at first thou cam'st to little wealth,\\n     ]From little unto more, from more to most:\\n     If your first curse fall heavy on thy head,\\n     And make thee poor and scorn'd of all the world,\\n     'Tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin. BARABAS. What, bring you Scripture to confirm your wrongs? Preach me not out of my possessions. Some Jews are wicked, as all Christians are:\\n     But say the tribe that I descended of\\n     Were all in general cast away for sin,\\n     Shall I be tried by their transgression? The man that dealeth righteously shall live;\\n     And which of you can charge me otherwise? FERNEZE. Out, wretched Barabas! Sham'st thou not thus to justify thyself,\\n     As if we knew not thy profession? If thou rely upon thy righteousness,\\n     Be patient, and thy riches will increase. Excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;\\n     And covetousness, O, 'tis a monstrous sin! BARABAS. Ay, but theft is worse:  tush! take not from me, then,\\n     For that is theft; and, if you rob me thus,\\n     I must be forc'd to steal, and compass more. FIRST KNIGHT. Grave governor, list not to his exclaims:\\n     Convert his mansion to a nunnery;\\n     His house will harbour many holy nuns. FERNEZE. It shall be so. Re-enter OFFICERS. Now, officers, have you done? FIRST OFFICER. Ay, my lord, we have seiz'd upon the goods\\n     And wares of Barabas, which, being valu'd,\\n     Amount to more than all the wealth in Malta:\\n     And of the other we have seized half. FERNEZE. Then we'll take [40] order for the residue. BARABAS. Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied? You have my goods, my money, and my wealth,\\n     My ships, my store, and all that I enjoy'd;\\n     And, having all, you can request no more,\\n     Unless your unrelenting flinty hearts\\n     Suppress all pity in your stony breasts,\\n     And now shall move you to bereave my life. FERNEZE. No, Barabas; to stain our hands with blood\\n     Is far from us and our profession. BARABAS. Why, I esteem the injury far less,\\n     To take the lives of miserable men\\n     Than be the causers of their misery. You have my wealth, the labour of my life,\\n     The comfort of mine age, my children's hope;\\n     And therefore ne'er distinguish of the wrong. FERNEZE. Content thee, Barabas; thou hast naught but right. BARABAS. Your extreme right does me exceeding wrong:\\n     But take it to you, i'the devil's name! FERNEZE. Come, let us in, and gather of these goods\\n     The money for this tribute of the Turk. FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis necessary that be look'd unto;\\n     For, if we break our day, we break the league,\\n     And that will prove but simple policy. [Exeunt all except BARABAS and the three JEWS.] BARABAS. Ay, policy! that's their profession,\\n     And not simplicity, as they suggest.--\\n     The plagues of Egypt, and the curse of heaven,\\n     Earth's barrenness, and all men's hatred,\\n     Inflict upon them, thou great Primus Motor! And here upon my knees, striking the earth,\\n     I ban their souls to everlasting pains,\\n     And extreme tortures of the fiery deep,\\n     That thus have dealt with me in my distress! FIRST JEW. O, yet be patient, gentle Barabas! BARABAS. O silly brethren, born to see this day,\\n     Why stand you thus unmov'd with my laments? Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs? Why pine not I, and die in this distress? FIRST JEW. Why, Barabas, as hardly can we brook\\n     The cruel handling of ourselves in this:\\n     Thou seest they have taken half our goods. BARABAS. Why did you yield to their extortion? You were a multitude, and I but one;\\n     And of me only have they taken all. FIRST JEW. Yet, brother Barabas, remember Job. BARABAS. What tell you me of Job? I wot his wealth\\n     Was written thus; he had seven thousand sheep,\\n     Three thousand camels, and two hundred yoke\\n     Of labouring oxen, and five hundred\\n     She-asses:  but for every one of those,\\n     Had they been valu'd at indifferent rate,\\n     I had at home, and in mine argosy,\\n     And other ships that came from Egypt last,\\n     As much as would have bought his beasts and him,\\n     And yet have kept enough to live upon;\\n     So that not he, but I, may curse the day,\\n     Thy fatal birth-day, forlorn Barabas;\\n     And henceforth wish for an eternal night,\\n     That clouds of darkness may inclose my flesh,\\n     And hide these extreme sorrows from mine eyes;\\n     For only I have toil'd to inherit here\\n     The months of vanity, and loss of time,\\n     And painful nights, have been appointed me. SECOND JEW. Good Barabas, be patient. BARABAS. Ay, I pray, leave me in my patience. You, that\\n     Were ne'er possess'd of wealth, are pleas'd with want;\\n     But give him liberty at least to mourn,\\n     That in a field, amidst his enemies,\\n     Doth see his soldiers slain, himself disarm'd,\\n     And knows no means of his recovery:\\n     Ay, let me sorrow for this sudden chance;\\n     'Tis in the trouble of my spirit I speak:\\n     Great injuries are not so soon forgot. FIRST JEW. Come, let us leave him; in his ireful mood\\n     Our words will but increase his ecstasy. [41]\\n\\n     SECOND JEW. On, then:  but, trust me, 'tis a misery\\n     To see a man in such affliction.--\\n     Farewell, Barabas. BARABAS. Ay, fare you well. [Exeunt three JEWS.] [42]\\n     See the simplicity of these base slaves,\\n     Who, for the villains have no wit themselves,\\n     Think me to be a senseless lump of clay,\\n     That will with every water wash to dirt! No, Barabas is born to better chance,\\n     And fram'd of finer mould than common men,\\n     That measure naught but by the present time. A reaching thought will search his deepest wits,\\n     And cast with cunning for the time to come;\\n     For evils are apt to happen every day. Enter ABIGAIL. But whither wends my beauteous Abigail? O, what has made my lovely daughter sad? What, woman! moan not for a little loss;\\n     Thy father has enough in store for thee. ABIGAIL. Nor for myself, but aged Barabas,\\n     Father, for thee lamenteth Abigail:\\n     But I will learn to leave these fruitless tears;\\n     And, urg'd thereto with my afflictions,\\n     With fierce exclaims run to the senate-house,\\n     And in the senate reprehend them all,\\n     And rent their hearts with tearing of my hair,\\n     Till they reduce [43] the wrongs done to my father. BARABAS. No, Abigail; things past recovery\\n     Are hardly cur'd with exclamations:\\n     Be silent, daughter; sufferance breeds ease,\\n     And time may yield us an occasion,\\n     Which on the sudden cannot serve the turn. Besides, my girl, think me not all so fond [44]\\n     As negligently to forgo so much\\n     Without provision for thyself and me:\\n     Ten thousand portagues, [45] besides great pearls,\\n     Rich costly jewels, and stones infinite,\\n     Fearing the worst of this before it fell,\\n     I closely hid. ABIGAIL. Where, father? BARABAS. In my house, my girl. ABIGAIL. Then shall they ne'er be seen of Barabas;\\n     For they have seiz'd upon thy house and wares. BARABAS. But they will give me leave once more, I trow,\\n     To go into my house. ABIGAIL. That may they not;\\n     For there I left the governor placing nuns,\\n     Displacing me; and of thy house they mean\\n     To make a nunnery, where none but their own sect [46]\\n     Must enter in; men generally barr'd. BARABAS. My gold, my gold, and all my wealth is gone!--\\n     You partial heavens, have I deserv'd this plague? What, will you thus oppose me, luckless stars,\\n     To make me desperate in my poverty? And, knowing me impatient in distress,\\n     Think me so mad as I will hang myself,\\n     That I may vanish o'er the earth in air,\\n     And leave no memory that e'er I was? No, I will live; nor loathe I this my life:\\n     And, since you leave me in the ocean thus\\n     To sink or swim, and put me to my shifts,\\n     I'll rouse my senses, and awake myself.--\\n     Daughter, I have it:  thou perceiv'st the plight\\n     Wherein these Christians have oppressed me:\\n     Be rul'd by me, for in extremity\\n     We ought to make bar of no policy. ABIGAIL. Father, whate'er it be, to injure them\\n     That have so manifestly wronged us,\\n     What will not Abigail attempt? BARABAS. Why, so. Then thus:  thou told'st me they have turn'd my house\\n     Into a nunnery, and some nuns are there? ABIGAIL. I did. BARABAS. Then, Abigail, there must my girl\\n     Entreat the abbess to be entertain'd. ABIGAIL. How! as a nun? BARABAS. Ay, daughter; for religion\\n     Hides many mischiefs from suspicion. ABIGAIL. Ay, but, father, they will suspect me there. BARABAS. Let 'em suspect; but be thou so precise\\n     As they may think it done of holiness:\\n     Entreat 'em fair, and give them friendly speech,\\n     And seem to them as if thy sins were great,\\n     Till thou hast gotten to be entertain'd. ABIGAIL. Thus, father, shall I much dissemble. BARABAS. Tush! As good dissemble that thou never mean'st,\\n     As first mean truth and then dissemble it:\\n     A counterfeit profession is better\\n     Than unseen hypocrisy. ABIGAIL. Well, father, say I be entertain'd,\\n     What then shall follow? BARABAS. This shall follow then. There have I hid, close underneath the plank\\n     That runs along the upper-chamber floor,\\n     The gold and jewels which I kept for thee:--\\n     But here they come:  be cunning, Abigail. ABIGAIL. Then, father, go with me. BARABAS. No, Abigail, in this\\n     It is not necessary I be seen;\\n     For I will seem offended with thee for't:\\n     Be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold. [They retire.] Enter FRIAR JACOMO, [47] FRIAR BARNARDINE, ABBESS, and a NUN. FRIAR JACOMO. Sisters,\\n     We now are almost at the new-made nunnery. ABBESS. [48] The better; for we love not to be seen:\\n     'Tis thirty winters long since some of us\\n     Did stray so far amongst the multitude. FRIAR JACOMO. But, madam, this house\\n     And waters of this new-made nunnery\\n     Will much delight you. ABBESS. It may be so.--But who comes here? [ABIGAIL comes forward.] ABIGAIL. Grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,\\n     Pity the state of a distressed maid! ABBESS. What art thou, daughter? ABIGAIL. The hopeless daughter of a hapless Jew,\\n     The Jew of Malta, wretched Barabas,\\n     Sometimes [49] the owner of a goodly house,\\n     Which they have now turn'd to a nunnery. ABBESS. Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us? ABIGAIL. Fearing the afflictions which my father feels\\n     Proceed from sin or want of faith in us,\\n     I'd pass away my life in penitence,\\n     And be a novice in your nunnery,\\n     To make atonement for my labouring soul. FRIAR JACOMO. No doubt, brother, but this proceedeth of\\n     the spirit. FRIAR BARNARDINE. Ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,\\n     Let us entreat she may be entertain'd. ABBESS. Well, daughter, we admit you for a nun. ABIGAIL. First let me as a novice learn to frame\\n     My solitary life to your strait laws,\\n     And let me lodge where I was wont to lie:\\n     I do not doubt, by your divine precepts\\n     And mine own industry, but to profit much. BARABAS. As much, I hope, as all I hid is worth. [Aside.] ABBESS. Come, daughter, follow us. BARABAS. [coming forward] Why, how now, Abigail! What mak'st thou 'mongst these hateful Christians? FRIAR JACOMO. Hinder her not, thou man of little faith,\\n     For she has mortified herself. BARABAS. How! mortified! FRIAR JACOMO. And is admitted to the sisterhood. BARABAS. Child of perdition, and thy father's shame! What wilt thou do among these hateful fiends? I charge thee on my blessing that thou leave\\n     These devils and their damned heresy! ABIGAIL. Father, forgive me-- [50]\\n\\n     BARABAS. Nay, back, Abigail,\\n     And think upon the jewels and the gold;\\n     The board is marked thus that covers it.--\\n          [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.] Away, accursed, from thy father's sight! FRIAR JACOMO. Barabas, although thou art in misbelief,\\n     And wilt not see thine own afflictions,\\n     Yet let thy daughter be no longer blind. BARABAS. Blind friar, I reck not thy persuasions,--\\n     The board is marked thus [51] that covers it--\\n          [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.] For I had rather die than see her thus.--\\n     Wilt thou forsake me too in my distress,\\n     Seduced daughter?--Go, forget not.-- [52]\\n          [Aside to her in a whisper.] Becomes it Jews to be so credulous?--\\n     To-morrow early I'll be at the door.--\\n          [Aside to her in a whisper.] No, come not at me; if thou wilt be damn'd,\\n     Forget me, see me not; and so, be gone!--\\n     Farewell; remember to-morrow morning.--\\n          [Aside to her in a whisper.] Out, out, thou wretch! [Exit, on one side, BARABAS. Exeunt, on the other side,\\n          FRIARS, ABBESS, NUN, and ABIGAIL:  and, as they are going\\n          out,]\\n\\n          Enter MATHIAS. MATHIAS. Who's this? fair Abigail, the rich Jew's daughter,\\n     Become a nun! her father's sudden fall\\n     Has humbled her, and brought her down to this:\\n     Tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,\\n     Than to be tired out with orisons;\\n     And better would she far become a bed,\\n     Embraced in a friendly lover's arms,\\n     Than rise at midnight to a solemn mass. Enter LODOWICK. LODOWICK. Why, how now, Don Mathias! in a dump? MATHIAS. Believe me, noble Lodowick, I have seen\\n     The strangest sight, in my opinion,\\n     That ever I beheld. LODOWICK. What was't, I prithee? MATHIAS. A fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,\\n     The sweetest flower in Cytherea's field,\\n     Cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,\\n     And strangely metamorphos'd [to a] nun. LODOWICK. But say, what was she? MATHIAS. Why, the rich Jew's daughter. LODOWICK. What, Barabas, whose goods were lately seiz'd? Is she so fair? MATHIAS. And matchless beautiful,\\n     As, had you seen her, 'twould have mov'd your heart,\\n     Though countermin'd with walls of brass, to love,\\n     Or, at the least, to pity. LODOWICK. An if she be so fair as you report,\\n     'Twere time well spent to go and visit her:\\n     How say you? shall we? MATHIAS. I must and will, sir; there's no remedy. LODOWICK. And so will I too, or it shall go hard. Farewell, Mathias. MATHIAS. Farewell, Lodowick. [Exeunt severally.] ACT II. Enter BARABAS, with a light. [53]\\n\\n     BARABAS. Thus, like the sad-presaging raven, that tolls\\n     The sick man's passport in her hollow beak, [54]\\n     And in the shadow of the silent night\\n     Doth shake contagion from her sable wings,\\n     Vex'd and tormented runs poor Barabas\\n     With fatal curses towards these Christians. The incertain pleasures of swift-footed time\\n     Have ta'en their flight, and left me in despair;\\n     And of my former riches rests no more\\n     But bare remembrance; like a soldier's scar,\\n     That has no further comfort for his maim.--\\n     O Thou, that with a fiery pillar ledd'st\\n     The sons of Israel through the dismal shades,\\n     Light Abraham's offspring; and direct the hand\\n     Of Abigail this night! or let the day\\n     Turn to eternal darkness after this!--\\n     No sleep can fasten on my watchful eyes,\\n     Nor quiet enter my distemper'd thoughts,\\n     Till I have answer of my Abigail. Enter ABIGAIL above. ABIGAIL. Now have I happily espied a time\\n     To search the plank my father did appoint;\\n     And here, behold, unseen, where I have found\\n     The gold, the pearls, and jewels, which he hid. BARABAS. Now I remember those old women's words,\\n     Who in my wealth would tell me winter's tales,\\n     And speak of spirits and ghosts that glide by night\\n     About the place where treasure hath been hid:\\n     And now methinks that I am one of those;\\n     For, whilst I live, here lives my soul's sole hope,\\n     And, when I die, here shall my spirit walk. ABIGAIL. Now that my father's fortune were so good\\n     As but to be about this happy place! 'Tis not so happy:  yet, when we parted last,\\n     He said he would attend me in the morn. Then, gentle Sleep, where'er his body rests,\\n     Give charge to Morpheus that he may dream\\n     A golden dream, and of [55] the sudden wake, [56]\\n     Come and receive the treasure I have found. BARABAS. Bueno para todos mi ganado no era: [57]\\n     As good go on, as sit so sadly thus.--\\n     But stay:  what star shines yonder in the east? [58]\\n     The loadstar of my life, if Abigail.--\\n     Who's there? ABIGAIL. Who's that? BARABAS. Peace, Abigail! 'tis I.\\n\\n     ABIGAIL. Then, father, here receive thy happiness. BARABAS. Hast thou't? ABIGAIL. Here. [throws down bags]  Hast thou't? There's more, and more, and more. BARABAS. O my girl,\\n     My gold, my fortune, my felicity,\\n     Strength to my soul, death to mine enemy;\\n     Welcome the first beginner of my bliss! O Abigail, Abigail, that I had thee here too! Then my desires were fully satisfied:\\n     But I will practice thy enlargement thence:\\n     O girl! O gold! O beauty! O my bliss! [Hugs the bags.] ABIGAIL. Father, it draweth towards midnight now,\\n     And 'bout this time the nuns begin to wake;\\n     To shun suspicion, therefore, let us part. BARABAS. Farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take\\n     A kiss from him that sends it from his soul. [Exit ABIGAIL above.] Now, Phoebus, ope the eye-lids of the day. And, for the raven, wake the morning lark,\\n     That I may hover with her in the air,\\n     Singing o'er these, as she does o'er her young. Hermoso placer de los dineros. [59]\\n          [Exit.] Enter FERNEZE, [60] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS. FERNEZE. Now, captain, tell us whither thou art bound? Whence is thy ship that anchors in our road? And why thou cam'st ashore without our leave? MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Governor of Malta, hither am I bound;\\n     My ship, the Flying Dragon, is of Spain,\\n     And so am I; Del Bosco is my name,\\n     Vice-admiral unto the Catholic King. FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis true, my lord; therefore entreat [61] him well. MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Our fraught is Grecians, Turks, and Afric Moors;\\n     For late upon the coast of Corsica,\\n     Because we vail'd not [62] to the Turkish [63] fleet,\\n     Their creeping galleys had us in the chase:\\n     But suddenly the wind began to rise,\\n     And then we luff'd and tack'd, [64] and fought at ease:\\n     Some have we fir'd, and many have we sunk;\\n     But one amongst the rest became our prize:\\n     The captain's slain; the rest remain our slaves,\\n     Of whom we would make sale in Malta here. FERNEZE. Martin del Bosco, I have heard of thee:\\n     Welcome to Malta, and to all of us! But to admit a sale of these thy Turks,\\n     We may not, nay, we dare not give consent,\\n     By reason of a tributary league. FIRST KNIGHT. Del Bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,\\n     Persuade our governor against the Turk:\\n     This truce we have is but in hope of gold,\\n     And with that sum he craves might we wage war. MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Will knights of Malta be in league with Turks,\\n     And buy it basely too for sums of gold? My lord, remember that, to Europe's shame,\\n     The Christian isle of Rhodes, from whence you came,\\n     Was lately lost, and you were stated [65] here\\n     To be at deadly enmity with Turks. FERNEZE. Captain, we know it; but our force is small. MARTIN DEL BOSCO. What is the sum that Calymath requires? FERNEZE. A hundred thousand crowns. MARTIN DEL BOSCO. My lord and king hath title to this isle,\\n     And he means quickly to expel you hence;\\n     Therefore be rul'd by me, and keep the gold:\\n     I'll write unto his majesty for aid,\\n     And not depart until I see you free. FERNEZE. On this condition shall thy Turks be sold.--\\n     Go, officers, and set them straight in show.--\\n          [Exeunt OFFICERS.] Bosco, thou shalt be Malta's general;\\n     We and our warlike knights will follow thee\\n     Against these barbarous misbelieving Turks. MARTIN DEL BOSCO. So shall you imitate those you succeed;\\n     For, when their hideous force environ'd Rhodes,\\n     Small though the number was that kept the town,\\n     They fought it out, and not a man surviv'd\\n     To bring the hapless news to Christendom. FERNEZE. So will we fight it out:  come, let's away. Proud daring Calymath, instead of gold,\\n     We'll send thee bullets wrapt in smoke and fire:\\n     Claim tribute where thou wilt, we are resolv'd,--\\n     Honour is bought with blood, and not with gold. [Exeunt.] Enter OFFICERS, [66] with ITHAMORE and other SLAVES. FIRST OFFICER. This is the market-place; here let 'em stand:\\n     Fear not their sale, for they'll be quickly bought. SECOND OFFICER. Every one's price is written on his back,\\n     And so much must they yield, or not be sold. FIRST OFFICER. Here comes the Jew:  had not his goods been seiz'd,\\n     He'd give us present money for them all. Enter BARABAS. BARABAS. In spite of these swine-eating Christians,\\n     (Unchosen nation, never circumcis'd,\\n     Poor villains, such as were [67] ne'er thought upon\\n     Till Titus and Vespasian conquer'd us,)\\n     Am I become as wealthy as I was. They hop'd my daughter would ha' been a nun;\\n     But she's at home, and I have bought a house\\n     As great and fair as is the governor's:\\n     And there, in spite of Malta, will I dwell,\\n     Having Ferneze's hand; whose heart I'll have,\\n     Ay, and his son's too, or it shall go hard. I am not of the tribe of Levi, I,\\n     That can so soon forget an injury. We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;\\n     And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks\\n     As innocent and harmless as a lamb's. I learn'd in Florence how to kiss my hand,\\n     Heave up my shoulders when they call me dog,\\n     And duck as low as any bare-foot friar;\\n     Hoping to see them starve upon a stall,\\n     Or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,\\n     That, when the offering-basin comes to me,\\n     Even for charity I may spit into't.--\\n     Here comes Don Lodowick, the governor's son,\\n     One that I love for his good father's sake. Enter LODOWICK. LODOWICK. I hear the wealthy Jew walked this way:\\n     I'll seek him out, and so insinuate,\\n     That I may have a sight of Abigail,\\n     For Don Mathias tells me she is fair. BARABAS. Now will I shew myself to have more of the serpent than\\n     the dove; that is, more knave than fool. [Aside.] LODOWICK. Yond' walks the Jew:  now for fair Abigail. BARABAS. Ay, ay, no doubt but she's at your command. [Aside.] LODOWICK. Barabas, thou know'st I am the governor's son. BARABAS. I would you were his father too, sir! that's all the harm\\n     I wish you.--The slave looks like a hog's cheek new-singed. [Aside.] LODOWICK. Whither walk'st thou, Barabas? BARABAS. No further:  'tis a custom held with us,\\n     That when we speak with Gentiles like to you,\\n     We turn into [68] the air to purge ourselves;\\n     For unto us the promise doth belong. LODOWICK. Well, Barabas, canst help me to a diamond? BARABAS. O, sir, your father had my diamonds:\\n     Yet I have one left that will serve your turn.--\\n     I mean my daughter; but, ere he shall have her,\\n     I'll sacrifice her on a pile of wood:\\n     I ha' the poison of the city [69] for him,\\n     And the white leprosy. [Aside.] LODOWICK. What sparkle does it give without a foil? BARABAS. The diamond that I talk of ne'er was foil'd:--\\n     But, when he touches it, it will be foil'd.-- [70]\\n          [Aside.] Lord Lodowick, it sparkles bright and fair. LODOWICK. Is it square or pointed? pray, let me know. BARABAS. Pointed it is, good sir,--but not for you. [Aside.] LODOWICK. I like it much the better. BARABAS. So do I too. LODOWICK. How shews it by night? BARABAS. Outshines Cynthia's rays:--\\n     You'll like it better far o' nights than days. [Aside.] LODOWICK. And what's the price? BARABAS. Your life, an if you have it [Aside].--O my lord,\\n     We will not jar about the price:  come to my house,\\n     And I will give't your honour--with a vengeance. [Aside.] LODOWICK. No, Barabas, I will deserve it first. BARABAS. Good sir,\\n     Your father has deserv'd it at my hands,\\n     Who, of mere charity and Christian ruth,\\n     To bring me to religious purity,\\n     And, as it were, in catechising sort,\\n     To make me mindful of my mortal sins,\\n     Against my will, and whether I would or no,\\n     Seiz'd all I had, and thrust me out o' doors,\\n     And made my house a place for nuns most chaste. LODOWICK. No doubt your soul shall reap the fruit of it. BARABAS. Ay, but, my lord, the harvest is far off:\\n     And yet I know the prayers of those nuns\\n     And holy friars, having money for their pains,\\n     Are wondrous;--and indeed do no man good;--\\n          [Aside.] And, seeing they are not idle, but still doing,\\n     'Tis likely they in time may reap some fruit,\\n     I mean, in fullness of perfection. LODOWICK. Good Barabas, glance not at our holy nuns. BARABAS. No, but I do it through a burning zeal,--\\n     Hoping ere long to set the house a-fire;\\n     For, though they do a while increase and multiply,\\n     I'll have a saying to that nunnery.-- [71]\\n          [Aside.] As for the diamond, sir, I told you of,\\n     Come home, and there's no price shall make us part,\\n     Even for your honourable father's sake,--\\n     It shall go hard but I will see your death.--\\n          [Aside.] But now I must be gone to buy a slave. LODOWICK. And, Barabas, I'll bear thee company. BARABAS. Come, then; here's the market-place.--\\n     What's the price of this slave? two hundred crowns! do the Turks\\n     weigh so much? FIRST OFFICER. Sir, that's his price. BARABAS. What, can he steal, that you demand so much? Belike he has some new trick for a purse;\\n     An if he has, he is worth three hundred plates, [72]\\n     So that, being bought, the town-seal might be got\\n     To keep him for his life-time from the gallows:\\n     The sessions-day is critical to thieves,\\n     And few or none scape but by being purg'd. LODOWICK. Rat'st thou this Moor but at two hundred plates? FIRST OFFICER. No more, my lord. BARABAS. Why should this Turk be dearer than that Moor? FIRST OFFICER. Because he is young, and has more qualities. BARABAS. What, hast the philosopher's stone? an thou hast, break\\n     my head with it, I'll forgive thee. SLAVE. [73] No, sir; I can cut and shave. BARABAS. Let me see, sirrah; are you not an old shaver? SLAVE. Alas, sir, I am a very youth! BARABAS. A youth! I'll buy you, and marry you to Lady Vanity, [74]\\n     if you do well. SLAVE. I will serve you, sir. BARABAS. Some wicked trick or other:  it may be, under colour\\n     of shaving, thou'lt cut my throat for my goods. Tell me,\\n     hast thou thy health well? SLAVE. Ay, passing well. BARABAS. So much the worse:  I must have one that's sickly, an't\\n     be but for sparing victuals:  'tis not a stone of beef a-day\\n     will maintain you in these chops.--Let me see one that's\\n     somewhat leaner. FIRST OFFICER. Here's a leaner; how like you him? BARABAS. Where wast thou born? ITHAMORE. In Thrace; brought up in Arabia. BARABAS. So much the better; thou art for my turn. An hundred crowns? I'll have him; there's the coin. [Gives money.] FIRST OFFICER. Then mark him, sir, and take him hence. BARABAS. Ay, mark him, you were best; for this is he\\n     That by my help shall do much villany.--\\n          [Aside.] My lord, farewell.--Come, sirrah; you are mine.--\\n     As for the diamond, it shall be yours:\\n     I pray, sir, be no stranger at my house;\\n     All that I have shall be at your command. Enter MATHIAS and KATHARINE. [75]\\n\\n     MATHIAS. What make the Jew and Lodowick so private? I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail. [Aside.] BARABAS. [to LODOWICK.] Yonder comes Don Mathias; let us stay: [76]\\n     He loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;\\n     But I have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,\\n     And be reveng'd upon the--governor. [Aside.] [Exit LODOWICK.] KATHARINE. This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son. MATHIAS. No, this is the better, mother, view this well. BARABAS. Seem not to know me here before your mother,\\n     Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:\\n     When you have brought her home, come to my house;\\n     Think of me as thy father:  son, farewell. MATHIAS. But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you? BARABAS. Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail. KATHARINE. Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew? BARABAS. As for the comment on the Maccabees,\\n     I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command. MATHIAS. Yes, madam, and my talk with him was [77]\\n     About the borrowing of a book or two. KATHARINE. Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.--\\n     Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.--Come, let's away. MATHIAS. Sirrah Jew, remember the book. BARABAS. Marry, will I, sir. [Exeunt KATHARlNE and MATHIAS.] FIRST OFFICER. Come, I have made a reasonable market; let's away. [Exeunt OFFICERS with SLAVES.] BARABAS. Now let me know thy name, and therewithal\\n     Thy birth, condition, and profession. ITHAMORE. Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;\\n     my profession what you please. BARABAS. Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,\\n     And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:\\n     First, be thou void of these affections,\\n     Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;\\n     Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,\\n     But to thyself smile when the Christians moan. ITHAMORE. O, brave, master! [78] I worship your nose [79] for this. BARABAS. As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,\\n     And kill sick people groaning under walls:\\n     Sometimes I go about and poison wells;\\n     And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,\\n     I am content to lose some of my crowns,\\n     That I may, walking in my gallery,\\n     See 'em go pinion'd along by my door. Being young, I studied physic, and began\\n     To practice first upon the Italian;\\n     There I enrich'd the priests with burials,\\n     And always kept the sexton's arms in ure [80]\\n     With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:\\n     And, after that, was I an engineer,\\n     And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,\\n     Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,\\n     Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:\\n     Then, after that, was I an usurer,\\n     And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,\\n     And tricks belonging unto brokery,\\n     I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,\\n     And with young orphans planted hospitals;\\n     And every moon made some or other mad,\\n     And now and then one hang himself for grief,\\n     Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll\\n     How I with interest tormented him. But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;--\\n     I have as much coin as will buy the town. But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time? ITHAMORE. Faith, master,\\n     In setting Christian villages on fire,\\n     Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves. One time I was an hostler in an inn,\\n     And in the night-time secretly would I steal\\n     To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:\\n     Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,\\n     I strewed powder on the marble stones,\\n     And therewithal their knees would rankle so,\\n     That I have laugh'd a-good [81] to see the cripples\\n     Go limping home to Christendom on stilts. BARABAS. Why, this is something:  make account of me\\n     As of thy fellow; we are villains both;\\n     Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:\\n     Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold. But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick. Enter LODOWICK. [82]\\n\\n     LODOWICK. O, Barabas, well met;\\n     Where is the diamond you told me of? BARABAS. I have it for you, sir:  please you walk in with me.--\\n     What, ho, Abigail! open the door, I say! Enter ABIGAIL, with letters. ABIGAIL. In good time, father; here are letters come\\n     ]From Ormus, and the post stays here within. BARABAS. Give me the letters.--Daughter, do you hear? Entertain Lodowick, the governor's son,\\n     With all the courtesy you can afford,\\n     Provided that you keep your maidenhead:\\n     Use him as if he were a Philistine;\\n     Dissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him: [83]\\n     He is not of the seed of Abraham.--\\n          [Aside to her.] I am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me.--\\n     Abigail, bid him welcome for my sake. ABIGAIL. For your sake and his own he's welcome hither. BARABAS. Daughter, a word more:  kiss him, speak him fair,\\n     And like a cunning Jew so cast about,\\n     That ye be both made sure [84] ere you come out. [Aside to her.] ABIGAIL. O father, Don Mathias is my love! BARABAS. I know it:  yet, I say, make love to him;\\n     Do, it is requisite it should be so.--\\n          [Aside to her.] Nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;\\n     But go you in, I'll think upon the account. [Exeunt ABIGAIL and LODOWICK into the house.] The account is made, for Lodovico [85] dies. My factor sends me word a merchant's fled\\n     That owes me for a hundred tun of wine:\\n     I weigh it thus much[snapping his fingers]! I have wealth enough;\\n     For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,\\n     And she vows love to him, and he to her. As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,\\n     So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:\\n     His father was my chiefest enemy. Enter MATHIAS. Whither goes Don Mathias? stay a while. MATHIAS. Whither, but to my fair love Abigail? BARABAS. Thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,\\n     That I intend my daughter shall be thine. MATHIAS. Ay, Barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much. BARABAS. O, heaven forbid I should have such a thought! Pardon me though I weep:  the governor's son\\n     Will, whether I will or no, have Abigail;\\n     He sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings. MATHIAS. Does she receive them? BARABAS. She! no, Mathias, no, but sends them back;\\n     And, when he comes, she locks herself up fast;\\n     Yet through the key-hole will he talk to her,\\n     While she runs to the window, looking out\\n     When you should come and hale him from the door. MATHIAS. O treacherous Lodowick! BARABAS. Even now, as I came home, he slipt me in,\\n     And I am sure he is with Abigail. MATHIAS. I'll rouse him thence. BARABAS. Not for all Malta; therefore sheathe your sword;\\n     If you love me, no quarrels in my house;\\n     But steal you in, and seem to see him not:\\n     I'll give him such a warning ere he goes,\\n     As he shall have small hopes of Abigail. Away, for here they come. Re-enter LODOWICK and ABIGAIL. MATHIAS. What, hand in hand! I cannot suffer this. BARABAS. Mathias, as thou lov'st me, not a word. MATHIAS. Well, let it pass; another time shall serve. [Exit into the house.] LODOWICK. Barabas, is not that the widow's son? BARABAS. Ay, and take heed, for he hath sworn your death. LODOWICK. My death! what, is the base-born peasant mad? BARABAS. No, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear\\n     Of that which you, I think, ne'er dream upon,--\\n     My daughter here, a paltry silly girl. LODOWICK. Why, loves she Don Mathias? BARABAS. Doth she not with her smiling answer you? ABIGAIL. He has my heart; I smile against my will. [Aside.] LODOWICK. Barabas, thou know'st I have lov'd thy daughter long. BARABAS. And so has she done you, even from a child. LODOWICK. And now I can no longer hold my mind. BARABAS. Nor I the affection that I bear to you. LODOWICK. This is thy diamond; tell me, shall I have it? BARABAS. Win it, and wear it; it is yet unsoil'd. [87]\\n     O, but I know your lordship would disdain\\n     To marry with the daughter of a Jew:\\n     And yet I'll give her many a golden cross [88]\\n     With Christian posies round about the ring. LODOWICK. 'Tis not thy wealth, but her that I esteem;\\n     Yet crave I thy consent. BARABAS. And mine you have; yet let me talk to her.--\\n     This offspring of Cain, this Jebusite,\\n     That never tasted of the Passover,\\n     Nor e'er shall see the land of Canaan,\\n     Nor our Messias that is yet to come;\\n     This gentle maggot, Lodowick, I mean,\\n     Must be deluded:  let him have thy hand,\\n     But keep thy heart till Don Mathias comes. [Aside to her.] ABIGAIL. What, shall I be betroth'd to Lodowick? BARABAS. It's no sin to deceive a Christian;\\n     For they themselves hold it a principle,\\n     Faith is not to be held with heretics:\\n     But all are heretics that are not Jews;\\n     This follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not.--\\n          [Aside to her.] I have entreated her, and she will grant. LODOWICK. Then, gentle Abigail, plight thy faith to me. ABIGAIL. I cannot choose, seeing my father bids:\\n     Nothing but death shall part my love and me. LODOWICK. Now have I that for which my soul hath long'd. BARABAS. So have not I; but yet I hope I shall. [Aside.] ABIGAIL. O wretched Abigail, what hast thou [89] done? [Aside.] LODOWICK. Why on the sudden is your colour chang'd? ABIGAIL. I know not:  but farewell; I must be gone. BARABAS. Stay her, but let her not speak one word more. LODOWICK. Mute o' the sudden! here's a sudden change. BARABAS. O, muse not at it; 'tis the Hebrews' guise,\\n     That maidens new-betroth'd should weep a while:\\n     Trouble her not; sweet Lodowick, depart:\\n     She is thy wife, and thou shalt be mine heir. LODOWICK. O, is't the custom? then I am resolv'd: [90]\\n     But rather let the brightsome heavens be dim,\\n     And nature's beauty choke with stifling clouds,\\n     Than my fair Abigail should frown on me.--\\n     There comes the villain; now I'll be reveng'd. Re-enter MATHIAS. BARABAS. Be quiet, Lodowick; it is enough\\n     That I have made thee sure to Abigail. LODOWICK. Well, let him go. [Exit.] BARABAS. Well, but for me, as you went in at doors\\n     You had been stabb'd:  but not a word on't now;\\n     Here must no speeches pass, nor swords be drawn. MATHIAS. Suffer me, Barabas, but to follow him. BARABAS. No; so shall I, if any hurt be done,\\n     Be made an accessary of your deeds:\\n     Revenge it on him when you meet him next. MATHIAS. For this I'll have his heart. BARABAS. Do so. Lo, here I give thee Abigail! MATHIAS. What greater gift can poor Mathias have? Shall Lodowick rob me of so fair a love? My life is not so dear as Abigail. BARABAS. My heart misgives me, that, to cross your love,\\n     He's with your mother; therefore after him. MATHIAS. What, is he gone unto my mother? BARABAS. Nay, if you will, stay till she comes herself. MATHIAS. I cannot stay; for, if my mother come,\\n     She'll die with grief. [Exit.] ABIGAIL. I cannot take my leave of him for tears. Father, why have you thus incens'd them both? BARABAS. What's that to thee? ABIGAIL. I'll make 'em friends again. BARABAS. You'll make 'em friends! are there not Jews enow in Malta,\\n     But thou must dote upon a Christian? ABIGAIL. I will have Don Mathias; he is my love. BARABAS. Yes, you shall have him.--Go, put her in. ITHAMORE. Ay, I'll put her in. [Puts in ABIGAIL.] BARABAS. Now tell me, Ithamore, how lik'st thou this? ITHAMORE. Faith, master, I think by this\\n     You purchase both their lives:  is it not so? BARABAS. True; and it shall be cunningly perform'd. ITHAMORE. O, master, that I might have a hand in this! BARABAS. Ay, so thou shalt; 'tis thou must do the deed:\\n     Take this, and bear it to Mathias straight,\\n          [Giving a letter.] And tell him that it comes from Lodowick. ITHAMORE. \""
