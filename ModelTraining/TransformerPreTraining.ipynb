the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p.4)            \\x93Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes. \\x94  In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened. The [CHARACTER], who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished, and it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to. They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the [CHARACTER] about it--he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand--so it generally ended in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman used to stand by with tears in his eyes; he knew it was all wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, \\x93No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm,\\x94 had been completed by the [CHARACTER]man himself with the words \\x93and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one. \\x94  So remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day. During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards. As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock, let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce \\x93slithy toves. \\x94  The \\x93i\\x94 in \\x93slithy\\x94 is long, as in \\x93writhe\\x94; and \\x93toves\\x94 is pronounced so as to rhyme with \\x93groves. \\x94  Again, the first \\x93o\\x94 in \\x93borogoves\\x94 is pronounced like the \\x93o\\x94 in \\x93borrow. \\x94  I have heard people try to give it the sound of the \\x93o\\x94 in \\x93worry\\x94. Such is Human Perversity. This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem. Humpty-Dumpty\\x92s theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. For instance, take the two words \\x93fuming\\x94 and \\x93furious. \\x94  Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards \\x93fuming,\\x94 you will say \\x93fuming-furious;\\x94 if they turn, by even a hair\\x92s breadth, towards \\x93furious,\\x94 you will say \\x93furious-fuming;\\x94 but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say \\x93frumious. \\x94  Supposing that, when [CHARACTER] uttered the well-known words--            \\x93Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die! \\x94  [CHARACTER] had felt certain that it was either William or Richard, but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he would have gasped out \\x93Rilchiam! \\x94                     Fit the First                    THE LANDING        \\x93Just the place for a Snark! \\x94 the [CHARACTER]man cried,           As he landed his crew with care;      Supporting each man on the top of the tide           By a finger entwined in his hair. \\x93Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:           That alone should encourage the crew. Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:           What I tell you three times is true. \\x94       The crew was complete: it included a Boots--           A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--      A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--           And a Broker, to value their goods. A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,           Might perhaps have won more than his share--      But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,           Had the whole of their cash in his care. There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,           Or would sit making lace in the bow:      And had often (the [CHARACTER]man said) saved them from wreck,           Though none of the sailors knew how. There was one who was famed for the number of things           He forgot when he entered the ship:      His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,           And the clothes he had bought for the trip. He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,           With his name painted clearly on each:      But, since he omitted to mention the fact,           They were all left behind on the beach. The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because           [CHARACTER] had seven coats on when he came,      With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,           He had wholly forgotten his name. He would answer to \\x93Hi! \\x94 or to any loud cry,           Such as \\x93Fry me! \\x94 or \\x93[CHARACTER]itter my wig! \\x94       To \\x93What-you-may-call-um! \\x94 or \\x93What-was-his-name! \\x94            But especially \\x93Thing-um-a-jig! \\x94       While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,           He had different names from these:      His intimate friends called him \\x93Candle-ends,\\x94            And his enemies \\x93Toasted-cheese. \\x94       \\x93His form is ungainly--his intellect small--\\x94            (So the [CHARACTER]man would often remark)      \\x93But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,           Is the thing that one needs with a Snark. \\x94       He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare           With an impudent wag of the head:      And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,           \\x93Just to keep up its spirits,\\x94 he said. He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--           And it drove the poor [CHARACTER]man half-mad--      He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,           No materials were to be had. The last of the crew needs especial remark,           Though he looked an incredible dunce:      He had just one idea--but, that one being \\x93[CHARACTER],\\x94            The good Bellman engaged him at once. He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,           When the ship had been sailing a week,      He could only kill Beavers. The [CHARACTER]man looked scared,           And was almost too frightened to speak:       But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,           There was only one Beaver on board;      And that was a tame one he had of his own,           Whose death would be deeply deplored. The [CHARACTER], who happened to hear the remark,           Protested, with tears in its eyes,      That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark           Could atone for that dismal surprise! It strongly advised that the Butcher should be           Conveyed in a separate ship:      But the Bellman declared that would never agree           With the plans he had made for the trip:       Navigation was always a difficult art,           Though with only one ship and one bell:      And he feared he must really decline, for his part,           Undertaking another as well. The Beaver\\x92s best course was, no doubt, to procure           A second-hand dagger-proof coat--      So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure           Its life in some Office of note:       This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire           (On moderate terms), or for sale,      Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,           And one Against Damage From Hail. Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,           Whenever the [CHARACTER] was by,      The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,           And appeared unaccountably shy. Fit the Second                     THE [CHARACTER]ELLMAN\\x92S SPEECH        The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--           Such a carriage, such ease and such grace! Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,           The moment one looked in his face! He had bought a large map representing the sea,           Without the least vestige of land:      And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be           A map they could all understand. \\x93What\\x92s the good of Mercator\\x92s North Poles and Equators,           Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines? \\x94       So the [CHARACTER]man would cry: and the crew would reply           \\x93They are merely conventional signs! \\x93Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes! But we\\x92ve got our brave Captain to thank:\\x94       (So the crew would protest) \\x93that he\\x92s bought us the best--           A perfect and absolute blank! \\x94       This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out           That the Captain they trusted so well      Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,           And that was to tingle his bell. He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave           Were enough to bewilder a crew. When he cried \\x93Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard! \\x94            What on earth was the helmsman to do? Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:           A thing, as the [CHARACTER] remarked,      That frequently happens in tropical climes,           When a vessel is, so to speak, \\x93snarked. \\x94       But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,           And the [CHARACTER]man, perplexed and distressed,      Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,           That the ship would not travel due West! But the danger was past--they had landed at last,           With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:      Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,           Which consisted of chasms and crags. The [CHARACTER]man perceived that their spirits were low,           And repeated in musical tone      Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--           But the crew would do nothing but groan. He served out some grog with a liberal hand,           And bade them sit down on the beach:      And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,           As he stood and delivered his speech. \\x93Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears! \\x94            (They were all of them fond of quotations:      So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,           While he served out additional rations). \\x93We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,           (Four weeks to the month you may mark),      But never as yet [\\x91tis your Captain who speaks)           Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark! \\x93We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,           (Seven days to the week I allow),      But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,           We have never beheld till now! \\x93Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again           The five unmistakable marks      By which you may know, wheresoever you go,           The warranted genuine Snarks. \\x93Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,           Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:      Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,           With a flavour of Will-o\\x92-the-wisp. \\x93Its habit of getting up late you\\x92ll agree           That it carries too far, when I say      That it frequently breakfasts at five-o\\x92clock tea,           And dines on the following day. \\x93The third is its slowness in taking a jest. Should you happen to venture on one,      It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:           And it always looks grave at a pun. \\x93The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,           Which is constantly carries about,      And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--           A sentiment open to doubt. \\x93The fifth is ambition. It next will be right           To describe each particular batch:      Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,           And those that have whiskers, and scratch. \\x93For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,           Yet, I feel it my duty to say,      Some are Boojums--\\x94 The Bellman broke off in alarm,           For the Baker had fainted away. Fit the Third                       THE BAKER\\x92S TALE        They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--           They roused him with mustard and cress--      They roused him with jam and judicious advice--           They set him conundrums to guess. When at length he sat up and was able to speak,           His sad story he offered to tell;      And the [CHARACTER]man cried \\x93Silence! Not even a shriek! \\x94            And excitedly tingled his bell. There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,           Scarcely even a howl or a groan,      As the man they called \\x93[CHARACTER]! \\x94 told his story of woe           In an antediluvian tone. \\x93My father and mother were honest, though poor--\\x94            \\x93Skip all that! \\x94 cried the [CHARACTER]man in haste. \\x93If it once becomes dark, there\\x92s no chance of a Snark--           We have hardly a minute to waste! \\x94       \\x93I skip forty years,\\x94 said the [CHARACTER], in tears,           \\x93And proceed without further remark      To the day when you took me aboard of your ship           To help you in hunting the Snark. \\x93A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)           Remarked, when I bade him farewell--\\x94       \\x93Oh, skip your dear uncle! \\x94 the Bellman exclaimed,           As he angrily tingled his bell. \\x93He remarked to me then,\\x94 said that mildest of men,           \\x93\\x91If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:      Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,           And it\\x92s handy for striking a light. \\x93\\x91You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;           You may hunt it with forks and hope;      You may threaten its life with a railway-share;           You may charm it with smiles and soap--\\x92\\x94       (\\x93That\\x92s exactly the method,\\x94 the [CHARACTER] bold           In a hasty parenthesis cried,      \\x93That\\x92s exactly the way I have always been told           That the capture of Snarks should be tried! \\x94)       \\x93\\x91But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,           If your Snark be a Boojum! For then      You will softly and suddenly vanish away,           And never be met with again! \\x92       \\x93It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,           When I think of my uncle\\x92s last words:      And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl           Brimming over with quivering curds! \\x93It is this, it is this--\\x94 \\x93We have had that before! \\x94            The Bellman indignantly said. And the [CHARACTER] replied \\x93Let me say it once more. It is this, it is this that I dread! \\x93I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--           In a dreamy delirious fight:      I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,           And I use it for striking a light:       \\x93But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,           In a moment (of this I am sure),      I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--           And the notion I cannot endure! \\x94                          Fit the fourth                         THE HUNTING        The [CHARACTER] looked huffish, and wrinkled his brow. \\x93If only you\\x92d spoken before! It\\x92s excessively awkward to mention it now,           With the Snark, so to speak, at the door! \\x93We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,           If you never were met with again--      But surely, my man, when the voyage began,           You might have suggested it then? \\x93It\\x92s excessively awkward to mention it now--           As I think I\\x92ve already remarked. \\x94       And the man they called \\x93[CHARACTER] \\x94 replied, with a sigh,           \\x93I informed you the day we embarked. \\x93You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--           (We are all of us weak at times):      But the slightest approach to a false pretence           Was never among my crimes! \\x93I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--           I said it in German and Greek:      But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)           That English is what you speak! \\x94       \\x93\\x91Tis a pitiful tale,\\x94 said the [CHARACTER]man, whose face           Had grown longer at every word:      \\x93But, now that you\\x92ve stated the whole of your case,           More debate would be simply absurd. \\x93The rest of my speech\\x94 (he explained to his men)           \\x93You shall hear when I\\x92ve leisure to speak it. But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again! \\x91Tis your glorious duty to seek it! \\x93To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;           To pursue it with forks and hope;      To threaten its life with a railway-share;           To charm it with smiles and soap! \\x93For the Snark\\x92s a peculiar creature, that won\\x92t           Be caught in a commonplace way. Do all that you know, and try all that you don\\x92t:           Not a chance must be wasted to-day! \\x93For England expects--I forbear to proceed:           \\x91Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:      And you\\x92d best be unpacking the things that you need           To rig yourselves out for the fight. \\x94       Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),           And changed his loose silver for notes. The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,           And shook the dust out of his coats. The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--           Each working the grindstone in turn:      But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed           No interest in the concern:       Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,           And vainly proceeded to cite      A number of cases, in which making laces           Had been proved an infringement of right. The maker of [CHARACTER] ferociously planned           A novel arrangement of bows:      While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand           Was chalking the tip of his nose. But the [CHARACTER] turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,           With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--      Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,           Which the Bellman declared was all \\x93stuff. \\x94       \\x93Introduce me, now there\\x92s a good fellow,\\x94 he said,           \\x93If we happen to meet it together! \\x94       And the [CHARACTER]man, sagaciously nodding his head,           Said \\x93That must depend on the weather. \\x94       The [CHARACTER] went simply galumphing about,           At seeing the Butcher so shy:      And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,           Made an effort to wink with one eye. \\x93Be a man! \\x94 said the [CHARACTER]man in wrath, as he heard           The Butcher beginning to sob. \\x93Should we meet with a [CHARACTER]bjub, that desperate bird,           We shall need all our strength for the job! \\x94                          Fit the Fifth                     THE BEAVER\\x92S LESSON        They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;           They pursued it with forks and hope;      They threatened its life with a railway-share;           They charmed it with smiles and soap. Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan           For making a separate sally;      And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,           A dismal and desolate valley. But the very same plan to the [CHARACTER] occurred:           It had chosen the very same place:      Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,           The disgust that appeared in his face. Each thought he was thinking of nothing but \\x93Snark\\x94            And the glorious work of the day;      And each tried to pretend that he did not remark           That the other was going that way. But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,           And the evening got darker and colder,      Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)           They marched along shoulder to shoulder. Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,           And they knew that some danger was near:      The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,           And even the [CHARACTER] felt queer. He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--           That blissful and innocent state--      The sound so exactly recalled to his mind           A pencil that squeaks on a slate! \\x93\\x91Tis the voice of the [CHARACTER]bjub! \\x94 he suddenly cried. (This man, that they used to call \\x93[CHARACTER]. \\x94)      \\x93As the [CHARACTER]man would tell you,\\x94 he added with pride,           \\x93I have uttered that sentiment once. \\x93\\x91Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;           You will find I have told it you twice. \\x91Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,           If only I\\x92ve stated it thrice. \\x94       The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,           Attending to every word:      But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,           When the third repetition occurred. It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,           It had somehow contrived to lose count,      And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains           By reckoning up the amount. \\x93Two added to one--if that could but be done,\\x94            It said, \\x93with one\\x92s fingers and thumbs! \\x94       Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,           It had taken no pains with its sums. \\x93The thing can be done,\\x94 said the Butcher, \\x93I think. The thing must be done, I am sure. The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,           The best there is time to procure. \\x94       The [CHARACTER] brought paper, portfolio, pens,           And ink in unfailing supplies:      While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,           And watched them with wondering eyes. So engrossed was the [CHARACTER], he heeded them not,           As he wrote with a pen in each hand,      And explained all the while in a popular style           Which the Beaver could well understand. \\x93Taking Three as the subject to reason about--           A convenient number to state--      We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out           By One Thousand diminished by Eight. \\x93The result we proceed to divide, as you see,           By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:      Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be           Exactly and perfectly true. \\x93The method employed I would gladly explain,           While I have it so clear in my head,      If I had but the time and you had but the brain--           But much yet remains to be said. \\x93In one moment I\\x92ve seen what has hitherto been           Enveloped in absolute mystery,      And without extra charge I will give you at large           A Lesson in Natural History. \\x94       In his genial way he proceeded to say           (Forgetting all laws of propriety,      And that giving instruction, without introduction,           Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),       \\x93As to temper the [CHARACTER]bjub\\x92s a desperate bird,           Since it lives in perpetual passion:      Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--           It is ages ahead of the fashion:       \\x93But it knows any friend it has met once before:           It never will look at a bribe:      And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,           And collects--though it does not subscribe. \\x93Its\\x92 flavour when cooked is more exquisite far           Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:      (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,           And some, in mahogany kegs:)       \\x93You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:           You condense it with locusts and tape:      Still keeping one principal object in view--           To preserve its symmetrical shape. \\x94       The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,           But he felt that the lesson must end,      And he wept with delight in attempting to say           He considered the Beaver his friend. While the [CHARACTER] confessed, with affectionate looks           More eloquent even than tears,      It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books           Would have taught it in seventy years. They returned hand-in-hand, and the [CHARACTER], unmanned           (For a moment) with noble emotion,      Said \\x93This amply repays all the wearisome days           We have spent on the billowy ocean! \\x94       Such friends, as the [CHARACTER] and Butcher became,           Have seldom if ever been known;      In winter or summer, \\x91twas always the same--           You could never meet either alone. And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds           Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--      The song of the [CHARACTER]bjub recurred to their minds,           And cemented their friendship for ever! Fit the Sixth                    THE [CHARACTER]RRISTER\\x92S DREAM        They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;           They pursued it with forks and hope;      They threatened its life with a railway-share;           They charmed it with smiles and soap. But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain           That the Beaver\\x92s lace-making was wrong,      Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain           That his fancy had dwelt on so long. He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,           Where the [CHARACTER]k, with a glass in its eye,      Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig           On the charge of deserting its sty. The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,           That the sty was deserted when found:      And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law           In a soft under-current of sound. The indictment had never been clearly expressed,           And it seemed that the Snark had begun,      And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed           What the pig was supposed to have done. The Jury had each formed a different view           (Long before the indictment was read),      And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew           One word that the others had said. \\x93You must know--\\x94 said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed \\x93Fudge! \\x94            That statute is obsolete quite! Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends           On an ancient manorial right. \\x93In the matter of Treason the pig would appear           To have aided, but scarcely abetted:      While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,           If you grant the plea \\x91never indebted. \\x92       \\x93The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;           But its guilt, as I trust, is removed      (So far as related to the costs of this suit)           By the Alibi which has been proved. \\x93My poor client\\x92s fate now depends on your votes. \\x94            Here the speaker sat down in his place,      And directed the Judge to refer to his notes           And briefly to sum up the case. But the Judge said he never had summed up before;           So the [CHARACTER]nark undertook it instead,      And summed it so well that it came to far more           Than the Witnesses ever had said! When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,           As the word was so puzzling to spell;      But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn\\x92t mind           Undertaking that duty as well. So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,           It was spent with the toils of the day:      When it said the word \\x93GUILTY! \\x94 the Jury all groaned,           And some of them fainted away. Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite           Too nervous to utter a word:      When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,           And the fall of a pin might be heard. \\x93Transportation for life\\x94 was the sentence it gave,           \\x93And _then_ to be fined forty pound. \\x94       The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared           That the phrase was not legally sound. But their wild exultation was suddenly checked           When the jailer informed them, with tears,      Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,           As the pig had been dead for some years. The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:           But the [CHARACTER]k, though a little aghast,      As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,           Went bellowing on to the last. Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed           To grow every moment more clear:      Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,           Which the Bellman rang close at his ear. Fit the Seventh                      THE BANKER\\x92S FATE        They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;           They pursued it with forks and hope;      They threatened its life with a railway-share;           They charmed it with smiles and soap. And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new           It was matter for general remark,      Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view           In his zeal to discover the Snark       But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,           A [CHARACTER]ersnatch swiftly drew nigh      And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,           For he knew it was useless to fly. He offered large discount--he offered a cheque           (Drawn \\x93to bearer\\x94) for seven-pounds-ten:      But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck           And grabbed at the Banker again. Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws           Went savagely snapping around--      He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,           Till fainting he fell to the ground. The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared           Led on by that fear-stricken yell:      And the [CHARACTER]man remarked \\x93It is just as I feared! \\x94            And solemnly tolled on his bell. He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace           The least likeness to what he had been:      While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--           A wonderful thing to be seen! To the horror of all who were present that day. He uprose in full evening dress,      And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say           What his tongue could no longer express. Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--           And chanted in mimsiest tones      Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,           While he rattled a couple of bones. \\x93Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late! \\x94            The Bellman exclaimed in a fright. \\x93We have lost half the day. Any further delay,           And we sha\\x92nt catch a Snark before night! \\x94                          Fit the Eighth                        THE VANISHING        They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;           They pursued it with forks and hope;      They threatened its life with a railway-share;           They charmed it with smiles and soap. They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,           And the [CHARACTER], excited at last,      Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,           For the daylight was nearly past. \\x93There is [CHARACTER]b shouting! \\x94 the [CHARACTER]man said,           \\x93He is shouting like mad, only hark! He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,           He has certainly found a Snark! \\x94       They gazed in delight, while the [CHARACTER] exclaimed           \\x93He was always a desperate wag! \\x94       They beheld him--their [CHARACTER]--their hero unnamed--           On the top of a neighboring crag. Erect and sublime, for one moment of time. In the next, that wild figure they saw      (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,           While they waited and listened in awe. \\x93It\\x92s a Snark! \\x94 was the sound that first came to their ears,           And seemed almost too good to be true. Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:           Then the ominous words \\x93It\\x92s a Boo-\\x94       Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air           A weary and wandering sigh      Then sounded like \\x93-jum! \\x94 but the others declare           It was only a breeze that went by. They hunted till darkness came on, but they found           Not a button, or feather, or mark,      By which they could tell that they stood on the ground           Where the [CHARACTER] had met with the Snark. In the midst of the word he was trying to say,           In the midst of his laughter and glee,      He had softly and suddenly vanished away---           For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see.'"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Inq93t0tueKv"},"source":["# # sample_text = \"This is your boy coming live from 203 69 street.
