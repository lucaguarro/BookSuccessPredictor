/raw_text This is the raw text as it was provided by maharjan

/raw_preprocessed This is still a textual dataset in which the original dataset was preprocessed via trimming and Named-Entity-Recognition on the characters

/already_tokenized Here contains the already tokenized datasets from the preprocessed input via the transformer tokenizers, Bert, Electra, Roberta, etc. etc.

/Pooled_Output This uses the tokenized dataset, feeds it through the corresponding transformer architecture (with a classification head) and extracts the pooled outputs of each sample. In addition there is also the average of all the samples coming from each respective book.
